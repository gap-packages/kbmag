\Chapter{The Automatic Groups Package}

The main aim of this package is to calculate the finite state automata
associated with a short-lex automatic group. At the end of a
successful calculation, four automata will be stored. These are the first
and second word-difference machines, the word-acceptor, and the multiplier.
The descriptions in this  chapter of the manual will assume some familiarity
with these objects on the part of the reader.
See \cite{EHR91} or \cite{Holt94} for details. One difference in the
current version from the existing {\Automata} package
is that a single multiplier automaton is calculated,
rather than a separate one for each generator.
This single multiplier is known as the general multiplier. Some of its states
are labeled by one of the group generators. These states are the accepting
states for that generator. To obtain the individual multipliers in minimized
form, run the program 'gpmult' (see Section "gpmult"). They are not normally
significantly smaller than the general multiplier, and there is one of them
for each generator, so usually the general multiplier provides a much more
compact way of storing the same information than the individual multipliers.

The resulting automata
can be used for reducing words to their unique minimal representative in
the group under the short-lex ordering (and thereby enabling the
word-problem to be solved in the group), and also for counting and
enumerating the accepted language.
See Sections "wordreduce (automatic groups)", "fsacount (automatic groups)"
and "fsaenumerate (automatic groups)" for details.
(In fact the multiplier automaton is not needed for any of these processes,
but it forms part of the automatic structure of the group from a
theoretical viewpoint, so we regard it as part of the output of the
calculation.)

There is also a program 'gpgeowa' that attempts to construct the geodesic
word acceptor of a word-hyperbolic group. In fact, by a result of
Papasoglu (\cite{PAP}), when it succeeds, it verifies that the
group is  word-hyperbolic. This program described in Section "gpgeowa".

There are two possibilities for computing the automatic structure.
The simplest is to use the program 'autgroup', which is in fact a
Unix Bourne-shell script, which runs the three C-programs involved,
and attempts to make a sensible choice of options.
The other possibility is to run these three programs 'kbprog -wd',
'gpmakefsa' and 'gpaxioms' individually, and to select the options oneself.
'kbprog -wd' runs the Knuth--Bendix process on the defining relations of the
group, and calculates the resulting word-differences arising from the
equations generated. If the group is short-lex automatic, then the set
of word-differences is finite, and so the calculated set will eventually
be complete; however, 'kbprog -wd' itself will normally run forever, generating
infinitely many equations, and so the difficulty is to devise sensible
halting criteria. Clearly one wants to halt as soon as all of the
word-differences have been found,if possible. Further details are given in
Section "kbprog -wd". 'gpmakefsa' uses the word-difference output by
'kbprog -wd' to compute the word-acceptor and multiplier automata.
It performs some checks on these which can reveal if the set of
word-differences used was not in fact complete, and find some of the
missing ones. It can then try again with the extended sets of
word-differences. Finally, the program 'gpaxioms' performs the
axiom-checking process, which proves the correctness of the automata
calculated. This process is expensive on resources in terms of both time
and space. Interestingly enough, we have never known it to complete and
return a negative answer; the reason for this is that the tests carried
out in 'gpmakefsa' tend to detect any errors in the automata.
So please inform me immediately if 'gpaxioms' ever reports that the
the structure calculated by 'kbprog\ -wd' and 'gpmakefsa' is incorrect!

For simple examples, these programs work quickly, and do not require
much space. For more difficult examples, they are often capable of
completing successfully, but they can sometimes be expensive in terms of
time and space requirements. If you are running out of space on your computer,
or it is starting to swap heavily, then there are some options available
in some cases (such as '-ip s' and '-f' for 'gpmakefsa' and 'gpaxioms')
which will cause things to use less space, but to take longer.
Another point to be borne in mind is that they produce temporary disk
files which the user does not normally see (because they are
automatically removed after use), but can occasionally be very large.
If you are in danger of exceeding your filestore allocation, or filling up
your disk partition, then you might try running the programs in the '/tmp'
directory. In any case, if a program halts unnaturally (perhaps because
you interrupt it), then you must remove these temporary files yourself.
If the file containing the original group presentation is  named
<groupname>, then all files created by the programs will have names of
form <groupname>'.'<suffix>.
\Section{autgroup}

'autgroup  [-l] [-v] [-silent] [-diff1] [-f] <groupname>'

Compute the finite state automata that constitute the automatic structure
of a short-lex automatic group. Input is taken from the file <groupname>,
which should contain a declaration of a record defining a rewriting-system, in
the format described in Chapter "Introduction". The rewriting-system must
define a group, so all monoid generators must have inverses listed explicitly
(there is no default convention for names of inverses). Output is to the
four files <groupname>'.diff1', <groupname>'.diff2', <groupname>'.wa' and
<groupname>'.gm', which contain, respectively, the first and second
word-difference automata, the word acceptor and the general multiplier.

*Options*\\
For a general description of the options '[-l]', '[-v]' and '[-silent]',
see Section
"Exit Status of Programs and Meanings of Some Options".
For greater flexibility in choice of options, run the programs 'kbprog\ -wd',
'gpmakefsa' and 'gpaxioms' individually, rather than using 'autgroup'. 

\begin{description}
\item[|-l |]
This causes 'gpmakefsa' and 'gpaxioms' to be run with the '-l' option, which
means large hash-tables. However, '-l' also causes 'kbprog\ -wd' to be run
with larger parameters, and you are advised to use it only after you
have tried first without it, since it will cause easy examples to take
much longer to run.
\item[|-diff1|]
This causes 'gpmakefsa' to be run with the '-diff1' option. See Section
"gpmakefsa" for further details.
\item[|-f |] This causes 'gpmakefsa' and 'gpaxioms' to be run with the
'-f' and '-ip s' options. See Sections "gpmakefsa" and "gpaxioms" for
further details. This is the option to choose if you need to save space,
and don\'t mind waiting a bit longer.
\end{description}
\Section{kbprog -wd}
'kbprog -wd [-t <tidyint>] [-me <maxeqns>] [-ms <maxstates>] \
[-mwd <maxwdiffs>]'\\
'| || || || || || || |[-hf <halting\_factor>] [-mt <min\_time>] \
[-rk <minlen> <mineqns>]'\\
'| || || || || || || |[-v] [-vwd] [-silent] [-cn <confnum>] <groupname>'

Some of these options are of course the same as for when 'kbprog' is being
used as a stand-alone Knuth--Bendix program -- see Section "kbprog".

'kbprog\ -wd' takes its input from the file <groupname>, which should contain a
declaration of a record defining a rewriting-system, in the format described
in Chapter "Introduction". Only the default ordering |"shortlex"| may be used,
since the other orderings make no sense in the automatic groups context.
Remember that the list of generators must include the inverses of all
generators.  Since the rewriting-system must define a group, rather than just
a monoid, the list of inverses, as specified in the 'inverses' field, must be
complete and involutory; i.e. all monoid generators must have inverses, and if
the inverse of <g1> is <g2> then the inverse of <g2> must be <g1>.

The Knuth--Bendix completion process is carried out on the group presentation.
However, unlike in the standalone usage of 'kbprog', the extended set of
equations and the reduction automaton are not output. Instead, the two
word-difference automata arising from the equations are output when the program
halts. These are printed to the two files <groupname>'.diff1' and
<groupname>'.diff2'. The difference between them is that the first automaton
contains only those word-differences and transitions that arise from the
equations themselves. For the second automaton, the set of word-differences
arising from the equations is closed under inversion, and all possible
transitions are included. So the second automaton has both more states and
generally more transitions per state than the first. For their uses, see
Section "gpmakefsa" below.

The main problem with this program is that, unless it completes with a
confluent set of equations, which happens relatively rarely for infinite groups,
the process will continue indefinitely, and so halting criteria have to be
chosen. If the group really is short-lex automatic with this choice of
ordered generating set, then the set of word-differences will be finite.
The general idea is to wait until it appears to have become constant, and
then stop.

There are two ways to do this. The first is to run 'kbprog\ -wd'
interactively with the '-v' option, when regular reports will be printed
on the current number of word-differences. (The word-differences are
calculated after each tidying operation on the equations; see the
'-t <tidyint>' option below.) The program can be interrupted at any time by the
user by sending it a single interrupt signal (which usually means typing
Control-C).  If you do this, then it will halt and output the current 
word-difference machines at the next convenient
opportunity (and so you may have to wait a while). If you send two interrupt
signals, then it will abort immediately without outputting.
The second way (and the one used by the shell-script 'autgroup') is to call
options which cause the program to halt automatically when the number of
word-differences has not increased for some time. This method is described
below under the option descriptions  '-hf <halting\_factor>' and
'-mt <min\_time>'.

This works well in simple examples, but there are various problems
associated with the more difficult examples. Firstly, it can happen that
most word-differences are found relatively quickly, but a few take much longer
to appear, and so the program is halted too early (either interactively or
automatically). This does not always matter, because the next program in
the sequence 'gpmakefsa' has the potential for finding missing word-differences
by performing checks on the automata that it calculates. However, this
will inevitably make 'gpmakefsa' run slower and use more space, and if too
many word-differences are missing, then it might not succeed at all. The thing
to do then, is to give up, and try running 'kbprog\ -wd' for longer, with more
stringent halting criteria (and possibly with a larger value of <tidyint>).
Another problem (the opposite problem) is that in some examples spurious
word-differences keep appearing and disappearing again, and so all required
word-differences may have been found long ago, but the reported number is
showing no sign of becoming constant. The only thing to do
when the number of word-differences keeps increasing and later decreasing
dramatically, is to try stopping it anyway (when the number is at
a low point), and then run 'gpmakefsa'.

Finally, if the number of word-differences is observed to increase quickly and
steadily, and gets up to about 2000, then it is likely that the group is not
short-lex automatic with this choice of ordered generators (and even if it is,
the size of the automata involved is likely to be too large for the
programs). Since short-lex automaticity is dependent on the choice of the
ordered generating set in some examples, it is worth trying different
choices of generators for the same group, and possibly different orderings
of the generators.

*Options*
\begin{description}
\item[|-t| <tidyint>] | |\newline
After finding <tidyint> new reduction equations, the program interrupts
the main process of looking for overlaps, to tidy up the existing set of
equations. This means eliminating any redundant equations and performing
some reductions on their left and right hand sides to make the set as
compact as possible. (The point is that equations discovered later often
make older equations redundant or too long.) The default value of
<tidyint> is 100, and it can be altered with this option. Different values
work better on different examples. This parameter can also be set by
including a |tidyint| field in the input file.
The word-differences arising from the equations are calculated
after each such tidying and the number reported if the '-v' option is called.
The best strategy in general is to try a small value of <tidyint> first and,
if that is not successful, try increasing it. Large values such as 1000 work
best in really difficult examples.
\item[|-me| <maxeqns>] | |\newline
This puts a limit on the number of reduction equations.
The default is 32767.
If exceeded, the program will stop and output the word-difference
automata arising from the current equations.
It can also be set as the field 'maxeqns' in the input file.
\item[|-ms| <maxstates>] | |\newline
This is less important, and not usually needed.
It sets a limit on the number of states of the finite state automaton
used for word reduction.
If exceeded, the program will stop and output the 
word-difference automata arising from current equations.
By default, there is no limit, and the space allocated is increased
dynamically as required. Occasionally, the space required can increase too fast
for the program to cope; in this case, you can try setting a higher limit.
It can also be set as the field 'maxstates' in the input file.
\item[|-mwd| <maxworddiffs>] | |\newline
Again this is not needed very often. It puts a bound on the number of
word-differences allowed. Normally, it is increased dynamically as required,
and so it does not need setting. Occasionally, it increases too fast for
the program to cope, and then it has to abort without output. If this
happens, try a larger setting.
\item[|-hf| <halting\_factor>]
\item[|-mt| <min\_time>]| |\newline
These are the experimental halting-options. If '-hf' is called, then
<halting\_factor> should be a positive integer, and represents a percentage.
After each tidying, it is checked whether both the number of
equations and the number of states have increased by more than
<halting\_factor> percent since the number of word-differences was last
less than what it is now.
If so, then the program halts and outputs the
word-difference automata arising from the current equations. A sensible value
seems to be 100, but occasionally a larger value is necessary. If the
'-mt' option is also called, then halting only occurs if at least <min\_time>
seconds of cpu-time have elapsed altogether.
This is sometimes necessary to prevent very early premature halting.
It is not very satisfactory, because of course the cpu-time
depends heavily on the particular computer being used, but no reasonable
alternative has been found yet.
There is no point in calling '-mt' without '-hf'.
\item[|-rk| <minlen> <mineqns>] | |\newline
Use the Rabin-Karp algorithm for word-reduction on words having length at least
<minlen>, provided that there are at least <mineqns> equations.
This uses less space than the default reduction automaton, but it is
distinctly slower, so it should only be used when you are seriously short of
memory.
The best settings for <minlen> and <mineqns> vary from example to
example - generally speaking, the smaller <minlen> is, the slower things
will be, so set it as high as possible subject to not running out of memory.
This option can also be set as a field in the input file.
The syntax for this is

'RabinKarp \:= [<minlen>,<mineqns>]'
\item[|-v |]
The verbose option. Regular reports on the current number of equations, etc. are
output. This is to be recommended for interactive use.
This parameter can also be set by including a |verbose| field in the input
file, and setting it equal to 'true'.
\item[|-vwd |]
The verbose word-differences option. In addition to the output produced
under |-v|, each new word-difference found is printed to 'stdout', together
with the equation from which it was calculated.
\item[|-silent|]
There is no output at all to 'stdout'.
This parameter can also be set by including a |silent| field in the input
file, and setting it equal to 'true'.
\item[|-cn| <confnum>] | |\newline
If <confnum> overlaps are processed and no new equations are discovered, then
the overlap searching process is interrupted, and a fast check for
confluence performed on the existing set of equations.
Setting <confnum> equal to 0 turns this feature off completely.
If, as is often the case, you are quite certain that the process is not going
to halt at all, then you should set <confnum> to 0, since the confluence
tests will merely waste time. (In fact, this should arguably be the
default setting for 'kbprog\ -wd'.)
It can also be set as the field 'confnum' in the input file.
\end{description}

*Exit status*\\
The exit status is 0 if 'kbprog' completes with a confluent set of equations,
or if it halts because the condition in the '-hf <halting\_factor>' option
has been fulfilled,
2 if it halts and outputs because some other limit has
been exceeded, or it has received an interrupt signal, and 1 if it exits
without output, with an error message.
This information is used by the shell-script 'autgroup'.

\Section{gpmakefsa}

'gpmakefsa  [-diff1/-diff2] [-me <maxeqns>] [-mwd <maxwdiffs>] [-f] [-l]'\\
'| || || || || || || || || || |[-ip d/s[dr]] [-opwa d/s] [-opgm d/s]\
[-v] [-silent] <groupname>'

Construct the word-acceptor and general multiplier finite state automata
for the short-lex automatic group, of which the rewriting-system defining
the group is in the file <groupname>.
It assumes that 'kbprog\ -wd' has already been run on the group.
Input is from <groupname>'.diff2' and, if
the '-diff1' option is called, also from <groupname>'.diff1'. The
word-acceptor is output to <groupname>'.wa' and the general multiplier to
<groupname>'.gm'. Certain correctness tests are carried out on the
constructed automata. If they fail, then new word-differences will be
found and <groupname>'.diff2' (and possibly also <groupname>'.diff1')
will be updated, and the multiplier (and possibly the word-acceptor)
will then be re-calculated.

There are programs available which construct the two automata individually,
and also one which performs the correctness test, but it is unlikely that
you will want to use them. They are mentioned briefly in
Section "Other programs".

The algorithm is slightly different according to whether or not
<groupname>'.diff1' or <groupname>'.diff2' is used as input to construct
the word-acceptor. This is controlled by the '-diff1' and '-diff2' options.
The latter is the default; i.e. the default is to use <groupname>'.diff2'.
Theoretically, <groupname>'.diff1' should work, and indeed it is more
efficient when it does work, because the first word-difference automaton is
always smaller than the second. However, in many examples it turns out that
<groupname>'.diff1' as output by 'kbprog\ -wd' is incorrect. In this case, it
is nearly always more efficient overall to use <groupname>'.diff2', which has
a much higher chance of calculating the correct word-acceptor first time. We
have therefore chosen to make this the default. There are one or two
examples, however, in which the use of <groupname>'.diff2' causes severe
space problems in constructing the word-acceptor, whereas <groupname>'.diff1'
does not. If you observe this to be the case, then try again with the
'-diff1' option set.

In the default setting, the word-acceptor and general multiplier are both
constructed using <groupname>'.diff2'. A check is then carried out on the
multiplier. In fact, it is checked that, for every word $u$ accepted by
the word-acceptor, and every generator $a$, there exists a word $v$
accepted by the word-acceptor such that $(u,v)$ is accepted by the multiplier,
where $ua$ and $v$ are equal in the group.
If this test fails, then the multiplier is incorrect, and a number of explicit
words $u$ and generators $a$ are calculated for which the test fails.
These give rise to equations $(u,v)$ (where $v$ is the word to which
$ua$ reduces), which produce new word-differences, which are in turn used
to re-calculate the second word-difference machine. The file
<groupname>'.diff2' is then updated, and the multiplier recalculated. It
may turn out in the course of this calculation that the word-acceptor also
needs recalculating, which is done if necessary. This process continues
until the multiplier passes the test.

Under the '-diff1' option, the file <groupname>'.diff1' is used to construct
the word-acceptor, but <groupname>'.diff2' is still used for the multiplier.
It may happen, during construction of the multiplier, that some equations
are found that should be accepted by the first word-difference machine, but
are not. These are used to correct the first word-difference machine, and
the file <groupname>'.diff1' is updated. Otherwise, things proceed as for the
'-diff2' option.

*Other options*
\begin{description}
\item[|-me| <maxeqns>] | |\newline
This specifies an upper limit on the number of equations that are processed
when correcting the first or second word-difference machines, as described
above. The default is 512. If it is too small, then the main testing and
correcting process on the multipliers may have to be repeated many more times
than necessary, but if it is too big, then the process of updating the
word-difference machines can be very slow.
\item[|-mwd| <maxwdiffs>] | |\newline
This puts an upper limit on the number of word-differences allowed after the
correction. It is rarely necessary to call this. If it is necessary, then the
program will halt with an informative error message.
\item[|-f |]
This is an option which saves space, at the expense of slightly increased
cpu-time. The multiplier automaton as initially constructed can be very
large. It is then minimized. Under this option, the unminimized multiplier
is not read in all at once, but kept in a file, and read in line-by-line
during minimization.
\end{description}
The remaining options are standard, and described in Section
"Exit Status of Programs and Meanings of Some Options".
Note, however, that the two '-op' options,
'-opwa' and '-opgm', refer to the output format of the word-acceptor and
general multiplier, resepctively. Since the former is one-variable and
the latter two-variable, the default is dense for the former and sparse
for the latter.
\Section{gpaxioms}

'gpaxioms [-ip d/s[dr]] [-op d/s] [-silent] [-v] [-l] [-f] [-n] <groupname>'

This program performs the axiom-checking process on the word-acceptor and
general multiplier of the short-lex automatic group,
of which the rewriting-system defining the group is in the file <groupname>.
It assumes that 'kbprog\ -wd' and 'gpmakefsa' has already been run on the
group.
It takes its input from <groupname> and <groupname>'.gm'. 
There is no output to files (although plenty of intermediate files are
created and later removed during the course of the calculation).

If successful, there will be no output apart from routine reports, and the exit
status will be 0. If unsuccessful, a message will be printed to 'stdout'
reporting that a relation test failed for one of the group relations, and
the exit status will be 2. I have never known this to happen, at least on
the output of a successful run of 'gpmakefsa', so if it does, please inform
me immediately!

*Options*
\begin{description}
\item[|-f|]
This is the same as in 'gpmakefsa'. That is, unminimized automata are not
read into memory all at once during minimization.
\item[|-n|]
Normally, 'gpaxioms' works by first calculating a general multiplier for
all words of length two in the group generators, and using these to
build up the composite multipliers for longer words. This seems to be
a good policy for nearly all examples, except possibly when there is
a very large number of generators and relatively few relators.
If the '-n' option is called, then this general multiplier is not
computed, and the composite multipliers are built up from the
single basic multiplier automata alone.
\end{description}

The other options are standard, and described in Section 
"Exit Status of Programs and Meanings of Some Options".
\Section{gpmult}

'gpmult [-ip d/s] [-op d/s] [-silent] [-v] [-l] <groupname>'

This calculates the individual multiplier automata, for the monoid
generators of the short-lex automatic group, of which the rewriting-system
defining the group is in the file <groupname>.
It assumes that 'autgroup' (or the three programs 'kbprog\ -wd', 'gpmakefsa'
and 'gpaxioms') have already been run successfully on the group.
Input is from <groupname>.'gm', and output is to <groupname>'.m'<n>
(one file for each multiplier), for $n = 1, \ldots , ng+1$, where $ng$ is
the number of monoid generators of the group. The final multiplier is
the equality multiplier, which accepts $(u,v)$ if and only if $u = v$ and
$u$ is accepted by the word-acceptor.
All of the options are standard.
\Section{gpminkb}

'gpminkb [-op1 d/s] [-op2 d/s] [-silent] [-v] [-l] <groupname>'

Suppose that the file <groupname> contains a rewriting-system
defining a short-lex automatic group,
and that 'autgroup' (or the three programs 'kbprog\ -wd', 'gpmakefsa'
and 'gpaxioms') have already been run successfully on the group.
This program calculates some associated automata, which can be
interesting and useful. Input is from <groupname>'.wa' and from
<groupname>'.diff2'.

Firstly, a finite state automaton which accepts the
minimal reducible words in the monoid generators (i.e. the set of
left-hand-sides  of the (probably infinite) minimal confluent set of
rewrite-rules) for the group is output to <groupname>'.minred'.
Secondly, a two-variable finite state automaton accepting precisely
this minimal confluent set of rewrite-rules
for the group is output to <groupname>'.minkb'.
Finally, the correct minimal first and second word-difference machines are
computed and output to <groupname>'.diff1c' and <groupname>'.diff2c'.
It may be interesting to compare these with <groupname>'.diff1' and
<groupname>'.diff2', but remember that the states may be in a different
order. (The states of a finite state automaton can be re-ordered into a
standard order with the program 'fsabfs'. See Section "fsabfs".)
The file <groupname>'.diff1c' can be used efficiently as input for
'wordreduce'; see Section "wordreduce (automatic groups)" below.

The options are all standard, but note that '-op1' refers to the format
of the one-variable automaton in <groupname>'.minred' (and is dense by
default), whereas '-op2' refers to the two-variable automata in
<groupname>'.minkb', <groupname>'.diff1c' and <groupname>'.diff2c',
and is sparse by default.

\Section{wordreduce (automatic groups)}
'wordreduce  [-kbprog/-diff1/-diff2/-diff1c] [-mrl <maxreducelen>] groupname'

This program can be used either on the output of 'kbprog' or on the output
of the automata package. The '-kbprog' option refers to the former use,
which is described in Section "wordreduce (Knuth--Bendix)".
The '-kbprog' usage is considerably quicker, but it is only guaranteed
accurate when a finite confluent set of equations has been calculated. 
The automatic groups programs are normally only used when such a set
cannot be found, in which case the usage here is the only
accurate one available.
The '-kbprog' usage is the default if the file <groupname>'.kbprog' is present.
To be certain of using the intended algorithm, call one of the flags
'-diff1', '-diff2', '-diff1c' explicitly.
If <groupname>'.kbprog' is not present, then input will be from
<groupname>'.diff2' by default, and otherwise from <groupname>'.diff1'
or <groupname>'.diff1c', according to which option is called.

It is assumed that the file <groupname> contains a rewriting-system
defining a short-lex automatic group,
and that 'autgroup' (or the three programs 'kbprog\ -wd', 'gpmakefsa'
and 'gpaxioms') have already been run successfully on the group.
The '-diff1' option should only be used for input if  'autgroup' or
'gpmakefsa' was run successfully with the '-diff1' option, in which
case it will be the most efficient. (Otherwise you might get wrong answers.)
The  '-diff1c' option can only be used if 'gpminkb' has already been run,
but in that case it will be the most efficient.

'wordreduce' reduces word in the group generators of the group to their
minimal irreducible equivalent under the short-lex ordering.
It can therefore be used to solve the word problem in the group.
'wordreduce' prompts for the words to be input at the terminal.

The option '-mrl\ <maxreducelen>' puts a maximum length on the words to
be reduced. (In the situation here, they can never get longer during reduction.)
The default is 32767.

\Section{fsacount (automatic groups)}
'fsacount  [-ip d/s] [-silent] [-v] [<filename>]'

This is one of the finite state automata functions. See Chapter
"Programs for Manipulating Finite State Automata" for the complete list.
The size of the accepted language is counted, and the answer (which may
of course be infinite) is output to 'stdout'. Input is from <filename> if
the optional argument is present, and otherwise from 'stdin', and it
should be a declaration of a finite state automaton record.

If 'autgroup' (or the three programs 'kbprog\ -wd', 'gpmakefsa'
and 'gpaxioms') have already been run successfully on the group defined
in the file <groupname>, then running 'fsacount <groupname>.wa'
will calculate the size of the group.
For description of options, see Section
"Exit Status of Programs and Meanings of Some Options".

\Section{fsaenumerate (automatic groups)}

'fsaenumerate  [-ip d/s] [-bfs/-dfs] <min> <max> [<filename>]'

This is one of the finite state automata functions. See Chapter
"Programs for Manipulating Finite State Automata" for the complete list.
Input is from <filename> if
the optional argument is present, and otherwise from 'stdin', and it
should be a declaration of a finite state automaton record.
<min> and <max> should be non-negative integers with <min> $\le$ <max>.
The words in the accepted language having lengths at least <min> and at
most <max> are enumerated, and output as a list of words to 'stdout'
or to the file <filename>'.enumerate'.

If 'autgroup' (or the three programs 'kbprog\ -wd', 'gpmakefsa'
and 'gpaxioms') have already been run successfully on the group defined
in the file <groupname>,
then running 'fsaenumerate <min> <max> <groupname>.wa'
will produce a list of elements in the group of which the reduced
word representatives have lengths between <min> and <max>.
If the option '-dfs' (depth-first search - the default) is called,
then the words
in the list will be in lexicographical order, whereas with '-bfs'
(breadth-first-search), they will be in order of increasing length, and in
lexicographical order for each individual length (i.e. in short-lex order).
Depth-first-search is marginally quicker.
For description of other options, see Section
"Exit Status of Programs and Meanings of Some Options".

\Section{gpgeowa}

'gpgeowa [-op1 d/s] [-op2 d/s] [-silent] [-v] [-l/-h] [-f] [-diff1/-diff2]'\\
'| || || || || || || | [-me <maxeqns>] [-mwd <maxwdiffs>] [-n] <groupname>'

This program attempts to construct the geodesic word-acceptor of a
word-hyperbolic group, after the automatic structure has been calculated.
In theory, it works whenever the group is word-hyperbolic, so if it
succeeds, then the group has been proved to have this property (due
to a result proved by Panos Papasoglu in~\cite{PAP}),
although it does not provide an estimate of the hyperbolic constant.
If the group is not word-hyperbolic, then 'gpgeowa' will not terminate.

It is assumed that the file <groupname> contains a rewriting-system
defining a short-lex automatic group,
and that 'autgroup' (or the three programs 'kbprog\ -wd', 'gpmakefsa'
and 'gpaxioms') have already been run successfully on the group.
The '-diff1' option should only be used for input if  'autgroup' or
'gpmakefsa' was run successfully with the '-diff1' option, in which
case it will be the most efficient. (Otherwise you might get wrong answers.)

Input is from <groupname>'.wa' and  <groupname>'.diff2' (or <groupname>'.diff1'
if the '-diff1' option is used). Output (when successful) is to the three
files <groupname>'.geowa', which contains the geodesic word-acceptor,
<groupname>'.geopairs', which contains a two-variable automaton whose
language consists of all pairs of equal geodesic words in the group generators,
and <groupname>.'geodiff', which contains a two-variable word-difference
machine, consisting of the word-differences and transitions necessary for
constructing <groupname>'.geopairs'.

The '-me <maxeqns>', '-mwd <maxwdiffs>' and '-f' options are similar to those in
'gpmakefsa' for example (see Section "gpmakefsa"). Other options are standard.

If the '-n' option is called, then an additional 2-variable automaton
is output to <groupname>'.near\_geopairs'.
This automaton accepts all pairs of geodesic words $u$ and $v$ such
such that $u^{-1}v$ has length at most one as a group element.

\Section{Other programs}

The other programs in the package will be simply listed here. For
further details, look at their source files in the 'src' directory.
If you are sure that you do not want them, and wish to save disk-space,
you can safely delete their executables from the 'bin' directory.
\begin{description}
\item['gpwa'] Calculate word-acceptor.
\item['gpgenmult'] Calculate general multiplier.
\item['gpcheckmult'] Carry out the correctness test on the general multiplier.
\item['gpgenmult2'] Calculate the general multiplier for words of length 2.
\item['gpmult2'] Calculate a particular multiplier for a word of length 2.
\item['gpcomp'] Calculate the composite of two multiplier automata.

\Section{Examples (automatic groups)}

There is a collection of examples of short-lex automatic groups in the
directory 'ag\_data' of widely varying difficulty. The automatic structure
has been calculated and verified as correct in all cases, however.
These can usefully be used as test examples for gaining experience in the
use of the programs. We therefore give a brief summary below of how
they behave.

The 'autgroup' program will complete successfully in its default form on the
following examples, in roughly increasing order of difficulty.
The cpu-times quoted are on a SPARCstation 20.
All 'degen<n>' examples, 'c2', 'ab1', 'f2', 'zw2', 'c5', 'ab2', '333',
'334', 'trefoil', '235', 'gp55', '236', '238', '237', 'f2\_unusual',
'shawcroft', 'torus', '237b' (up to this example, they took less than
10 seconds cpu-time), 'listing', 'f26',
'johnson', '777', 'gunn', 'hamish12', 'G1L1', 's9', 'cox535' (less than
a minute up to this example), 'knot23', 'hamish13', 'hamish23',
'orbifold', 'johnsonc', 'f28', the last taking just under 4 minutes. 
Then, 'edjvet\_94\_1' takes about 18 minutes, 'picard' 35 minutes and 'andre'
90 minutes.  Remember, that the '-f' option can be used for the larger
examples if there are problems with memory or swapping, in which case
the times will be a little longer; for example, 'edjvet\_94\_1' took just under
20 minutes with '-f' on.

For the examples, 'cox33334c' and 'cox5335', the '-diff1' option needs
to be used. The former takes about 17 minutes and the latter 215 minutes.
However, 'cox5335' works much better with the '-l' option on as well, when
it only needs about 63 minutes. The examples 'surgery' and 'johnsonb'
only complete with the '-l' option called, and take 65 and 150 minutes,
respectively. 'f29' does not complete at all by just running 'autgroup -l',
since the limit imposed on the maximum number of equations in 'kbprog' is
still too small. This can be completed with a limit of about 500000 on
the 'maxeqns' parameter, but it produces a temporary file of size about 140
Megabytes during the course of the calculation.
