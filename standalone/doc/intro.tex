\Section{What is KBMAG?}
{\KBMAG} (pronounced ``Kay-bee-mag\'\')
stands for *Knuth--Bendix on Monoids, and Automatic Groups*.
The purpose of this manual is to provide instructions for its use as a
stand-alone package.  It is also usable from within Version 3 of the {\GAP}
system (see \cite{Sch92}), and instructions for its use in that setting appear
as a chapter of the {\GAP} manual in the directory 'gapdoc'.
Some information on the interface with {\GAP} is also described in Chapter
"The Interface with GAP" of this manual.

The applications of {\KBMAG} can be divided into six inter-relating
categories. These are covered in detail in the Chapters
"The Knuth--Bendix Program for Monoids",
"The Automatic Groups Package",
"The Knuth--Bendix Program for Cosets of Subgroups",
"The Automatic Coset System and Subgroup Presentation Package",
"Creating Subgroup Word Acceptors", and
"Programs for Manipulating Finite State Automata",
but we will summarize them here.
Note that the third, fourth and fifth applications, relating to subgroups and
cosets, were new in Version 2.

Firstly, the program 'kbprog' can be used by itself to carry out the
Knuth--Bendix completion procedure on monoids defined by a finite presentation
and, in particular, on finitely presented groups. The user has a choice
between the short-lex ordering and the recursive-path ordering on strings.
Weighted lex and wreath-product orderings, are also available.
The latter are defined on pages 46 -- 50 of \cite{Sims94}.
(It would be easy to make other orderings available if there were ever any
demand.) The implementation is designed more with speed of execution in mind
than with minimizing space requirements; thus, a finite state automaton is
always used to carry out word reduction, which can be space-consuming,
particularly when the number of generators is large. For a more flexible
Knuth--Bendix package, with more general orderings available, and a
choice of word-reduction procedures, the user could try the Rutgers
Knuth--Bendix package {\rkbp} written by Charles Sims. 
After running the program, the current set of reduction rules can be used to
reduce words in the monoid generators. If the rewriting-system produced is
confluent, then words will be correctly reduced to their irreducible normal
form under the given ordering, and so the word problem can be solved efficiently
in the monoid.

Secondly, the package can be used to compute the finite state automata
that constitute the automatic structure of a short-lex automatic group.
This supersedes the olderexisting Warwick {\Automata} package for this purpose;
the current program is generally faster than {\Automata}, and successful with
more examples. For general information about automatic groups, see
\cite{ECHLPT92}, and for more detailed information about the algorithms
used in {\Automata}, see \cite{EHR91} or \cite{Holt94}. There are 
no fundamentally new algorithms employed in {\KBMAG}, but several
improvements have been made to the various components. The most
noticeable change is that a single multiplier automaton is now computed,
with the states labeled to indicate for which generators they are success
states, rather than a separate multiplier for each generator (although the
separate multipliers can still be computed if desired).

Computing an automatic structure is done in several steps, which are
carried out by a number of individual 'C'-programs. A Bourne Shell script,
called 'autgroup' has been provided to run these programs in the correct
sequence with, hopefully, a sensible default choice of options. As an
alternative to the use of this shell script, the individual programs can of
course be run separately. The first step is to run the program
'kbprog', but with the ``word-difference\'\'\ option, which is required
for automatic group calculations. The next program (which can itself be
divided up into different parts if required) computes the word-acceptor
and multiplier automata for the group. The final program (which can again
be split into parts), is the so-called axiom-checking process, which proves
that the automata that have been calculated are correct.
If the process runs to completion, then the automata can be used to reduce
words in the group generators to their irreducible normal forms under the
short-lex ordering, and so the word problem in the group can be solved
efficiently. It is also possible to compute the rational growth function
for the group by applying the program 'fsagrowth' (see Chapter 8) to its
word-acceptor.

If the group happens to be word-hyperbolic then,
after computing the automatic structure as described above, it is
possible to run a program 'gpgeowa', which computes an automaton that accepts
all geodesic words in the group generators and a 2-variable automaton that
accepts all pairs of geodesic words which represent the same group element.
In fact, by a result of Papsoglu~(\cite{PAP}), if 'gpgeowa'
succeeds, then it effectively verifies the word-hyperbolicity of the
group.
 
Thirdly, there is a variant of 'kbprog' named 'kbprogcos' that is designed to
work on the right cosets of a subgroup of the input group, at the same time
as on the group itself. (The input structure could, more generally, be a
monoid, but in order for the calculations carried out by the program to
make any mathematical sense, it is probably necessary for the substructure to be
a group.) In case of completion, a presentation of the subgroup
can be calculated on the given subgroup generators.  This will always work in
case of a subgroup of finite index, but the better known Reidemeister-Schreier
and Todd-Coxeter related methods for subgroup presentations are likely to be
superior in this case (see, for example, \cite {Neu81}).

Fourthly, there are programs for calculating the finite state automata
that constitute an automatic coset system for certain subgroups $H$ of
short-lex automatic groups $G$. In particular, the coset word-acceptor, that
accepts the unique short-lex minimal word that lies in each right coset
of $H$ in $G$, and the coset general multiplier, that accepts the pair of words
$(w_1,w_2)$ if and only if $w_1$ and $w_2$ are accepted by the coset
word-acceptor and $Hw_1x=Hw_2$ for some monoid generator $x$ of $G$, are
constructed. In successful cases, a presentation of $H$ can also be computed. 

The first programs to calculate these structures
were written by Ian Redfern and described by him in his Ph.D.thesis
(\cite{Red93}), together with some nice graphical applications to drawing
limit sets of Kleinian groups. He also proved that automatic coset systems
exist for all quasiconvex subgroups of word-hyperbolic groups. (Apart from
this, there appear to be no theoretical results that will predict for
which subgroups $H$ automatic coset systems will exist but, by running the
programs, we find that they do indeed exist in many cases.)
The programs in {\KBMAG} employ a different method that uses finite state
automata that have deterministic transition tables, but may have more than one
initial state. It has the advantage over Redfern\'s that the structures
computed can be proved correct.

As in the case of ordinary automatic structures, these calculations are
done in several steps, and a Bourne Shell script is provided, called
'autcos', that  runs the appropriate programs in the correct order, with
a sensible default choice of options. The  steps correspond roughly to those of
'autgroup', the first being 'kbprogcos' with the ``word-difference\'\'
option.  There is an optional additional step at the end to compute a
presentation of the subgroup $H$. This usually contains many redundant
generators and relators, and is output as a file that can be read immediately
by {\GAP}, so that the presenation can be simplified. It is planned, at some
stage in the future, the facility to compute a presentation using the original
given generators of $H$ will be provided.

The fifth application is for the construction of a finite state automaton
that accepts a unique word for each element of a suitable subgroup $H$ of
a short-lex automatic group $G$. An automatic structure must first be computed
for $G$ by using 'autcos' or its constituents, and the word-acceptor for $H$
will accept precisely those words that lie in $H$ and are accepted by the
word-acceptor for $G$. Theoretically, it will work whenever $H$ is a
quasiconvex subgroup of $G$. The algorithm employed has some features in
common with that described in Section 2 of \cite{Kar94} (see there also for
theoretical details and further references). In particular, the
correctness verification part of it is identical to that described in
\cite{Kar94}, but for the construction of the word-acceptor for $H$,
{\KBMAG} uses Knuth-Bendix based methods rather than Todd-Coxeter coset
enumeration.

The sixth and final application of the package is for general manipulation of
finite state automata. Most of the routines provided operate on
deterministic automata. However, there is a program 'nfadeterminize',
which inputs a non-deterministic automaton and outputs a deterministic
one with the same language. 
There is also a program 'midfadeterminize' that handles the
important special case in which the input automaton is
a multiple-initial-state automaton with deterministic transition table
(see above).

There are programs for carrying out logical operations
on automata (in fact, some of the functions that they call are also used
in the automatic group calculations).  There are also programs to count
and to enumerate the language of a finite state automaton. These are
likely to be interesting to apply to the automata associated with
an automatic group, or to the reduction automaton output by 'kbprog' in
its stand-alone mode. There are a number of other, more dedicated,
packages that are available for manipulating finite state automata and
regular expressions. One such is {\Automate} (see \cite{Rie87} or
\cite{ChH91}), and another {\Grail} (see ??) developed at Ontario.

\Section{File formats}
The programs in {\KBMAG} generally do all of their serious input and output
from files, and only print diagnostics to 'stdout'. These files conform to
the format of the Version 3 of the {\GAP} system \cite{Sch92} and so are
readable from within {\GAP}. See the {\GAP} manual chapter in the 'gapdoc'
directory, or Chapter "The Interface with GAP" for details of how to use
{\KBMAG} from within {\GAP}.

Two principal types of objects are handled, rewriting-systems and
finite state automata. Each file contains a single {\GAP} declaration, which
defines one object of one of these two types. This takes the general form

'<identifier> \:= rec(<list>);'

where <list> is a comma-separated list
of field-definitions that specify the values of the fields of the object
being defined. The two types of object are distinguished by the first
such definition, which must be either

|isRWS := true| \hspace{1cm}  or \hspace{1cm}  |isFSA := true|

for rewriting-systems and finite state automata, respectively.
Subgroups of the group or monoid defined by a rewriting system can also be
defined in a separate file, as described in Chapter
"Subgroup and Coset Files".

To use the interface with {\GAP} in its current form, the name of a
rewriting-system (i.e. the value of <identifier>) has to be '\_RWS'.
This is because the relevant {\GAP} functions have '\_RWS' defined as an
external variable, and expect a declaration of this form.

Formal definitions of these formats have not yet been written down.
There is a text document giving an informal, and not completely up-to-data
description of the finite state automaton format in the {\KBMAG}
directory 'doc'. Examples of files containing rewriting-systems can be
found in the directories 'kb\_data' and 'ag\_data', and examples of
finite state automata in 'fsa\_data'. Rather than attempt a description
here, we suggest that the reader takes a look at some of these files.

{\sf Handy Tip\:} Reading the transition table directly from a file that
contains the definition of an automaton with a large number of states
can be difficult, because the rows of the table are not numbered in the
file. Such numbering can be introduced as comments, by running the
program 'fsafilter' with the '-csn' option; see Section "fsafilter".
An alternative and more versatile way of accessing the information
about the automaton is to read it into {\GAP} and then use the {\GAP}
functions provided; see Chapter "The Interface with GAP".

For the Knuth--Bendix and automatic group applications, the user has to
supply a rewriting-system that defines a monoid or group in a file as input.
For applications related to cosets of subgroups, an additional file
defining generators of the subgroup must also be supplied.
The programs produce new files containing rewriting-systems or automata.
In general, the user\'s file will contain a declaration of the above type,
and the computed files will contain a declaration of form

'<identifier>.<suffix> \:= rec(<list>);'

for the same <identifier>, so that if the user reads these files from
within {\GAP}, and the input file is read first, then, from {\GAP}\'s
viewpoint, the computed files will define new components of the original
record. (As mentioned above, for use with {\GAP}, the value of
<identifier> should always be '\_RWS'.)

The best method (and the one always employed by the author)
of creating an input file is to copy an existing one and edit it.
Let us briefly look at an example and discuss it.

|
#Free nilpotent group of rank 2 and class 2
_RWS := rec(
           isRWS := true,
  generatorOrder := [c,C,b,B,a,A],
        inverses := [C,c,B,b,A,a],
        ordering := "recursive",
       equations := [
         [b*a,a*b*c], [c*a,a*c], [c*b,b*c]
       ]
);
|

The first line is a comment, and is ignored by programs. (In general,
comments are preceded by the `\#\'\ symbol and last to the end of the line.)
To comply with the current {\GAP} interface, we name our rewriting-system
'\_RWS'.
As we saw above, the first field definition merely states that this is a
definition of a rewriting system.

The |ordering|\ field specifies which
ordering on strings in the input alphabet is to be used by the Knuth--Bendix
program. Although there is a default ordering, which is '\"shortlex\"',
this field is required by the {\GAP} interface, so it is recommended that
it should always be included.
It is also possible
to define the ordering by means of a command-line option to 'kbprog'
however. The convention for this, and various other fields, is that
command-line options override settings in the file in case of conflict.
Full details of these options are given in Chapters
"The Knuth--Bendix Program for Monoids" and "The Automatic Groups Package".

The remaining three fields provide the definition of the group or monoid.
First comes a list of generators. They must generate the structure as a monoid,
even if it is a group; this means inverses should be included in the generator
list. The field is named |generatorOrder|\ to emphasize the fact that the
order is relevant - it will affect the ordering of strings in the alphabet.
The names of the generators should be alphanumeric strings. In fact,
dots and underscores are also allowed, for compatibility with {\GAP}.
Case is significant. It is recommended to use single letters, and use
case-change for inversion, as we have done in this example. Another
recommended policy is to use a common prefix followed by numbers; for
example, a file output by {\GAP} might have its generators named
'G.1, G.2, ..., G.n' for some $n \ge 0$. It is also permissible to name a
generator <name>'\^-1', where <name> is the name of another generator, and
the two are mutually inverse.

The |inverses|\ field supplies the list of two-sided inverses of the
generators, in the same order as the generators. This field must be present,
but, in general, not all generators need have inverses, so the list could
be empty, or contain gaps. For example, if only the first and third
generators have inverses, and these are named 'i1' and 'i2', then the list
would be written as '[i1,,i2]'.  However, if generator 'A' is listed as the
inverse of 'a', then 'a' must also be listed as the inverse of 'A'.
There is currently no mechanism for inputting one-sided inverses (although
that would be useful information for 'kbprog' under some circumstances, and so
it may be introduced in the future).
In the automatic groups applications, the structure must be a group, and all
generators must have inverses specified in the list.
(Currently, there is no way of specifying a default convention, such as
inversion equals case-change. We may introduce such a convention in
future, but this will depend on whether it can be made meaningful to
{\GAP}.)

Finally, there comes the |equations|\ field. This consists of a list of
lists. Each inner list constitutes a defining relation for the
monoid, and should have two entries, which are words in the generators,
and are the left and right hand sides of the relation.
The empty word is denoted (as in {\GAP}) by 'IdWord'.
The word may contain brackets to any level, and positive powers.
So, for example 'a\*(b\*(A\*c)\^4)\^3\*c\^12' is a valid word in the generators
in the example above.
Since the word is in the monoid generators, not all of which will
necessarily have inverses, negative powers are not permitted.
However, if a generator is named 'a\^-1', for example, then the <n>-th 
power of it should be written as 'a\^-'<n> rather than as 'a\^-1\^'<n>.

It is not necessary to include defining relations of type
'[a\*A,IdWord]' in the list of equations, where the generators 'a' and 'A'
have been already been specified as mutually inverse in the ``|inverses|\'\'
field, and this has not been done in the example above. On the other hand
it does no harm if you do include them, and they will be included in
lists of equations output by 'kbprog'.

There are a number of other optional fields, which do not occur in this example,
and provide further detailed instructions for the Knuth--Bendix program.
See the description of this program in Section "kbprog" for details.

For a description of the format of files defining subgroups, see
Chapter "Subgroup and Coset Files".

\Section{Exit Status of Programs and Meanings of Some Options}

The exit status of nearly all of the programs is 0 if successful and
1 if unsuccessful, and the program aborts with an error message
to 'stderr', without outputting to file.
One or two of the programs can also exit with status 2, which means that
something unusual but non-fatal has occurred. The two most important are
'kbprog' and 'gpaxioms'; see Sections "kbprog", "kbprog -wd", and
"gpaxioms".

Many of the options to the individual programs in {\KBMAG} have the same
meaning wherever they occur. To avoid repeating them over and over again, we
list some of them here.
\begin{description}
\item[|-v |]
The verbose option. A certain amount of extra information on progress of
calculation is printed out to stdout.
(By default, only the main results of calculations are printed out as
comments to stdout.)
\item[|-silent|]
There is no output at all to 'stdout'.
The only output to the terminal is error messages when the program
aborts for some reason.
\item[|-vv |]
The very-verbose option. A huge amount of diagnostic information is printed out,
much of which may seem incomprehensible.
\item[|-l |]
Large hash-tables. When constructing finite state automata, the states
are identified as sequences of integers, sometimes of varying length.
The sequences are stored in open hash-tables. Space is allocated as
required in blocks. The default size of the block is $2^{18}$ bytes;
with the '-l' option it becomes $2^{21}$ bytes. This makes things
run more efficiently when constructing very large automata.
There is also a '-h' option (huge hash-tables).
\item[|-ip d|]
Store finite state automata in dense format, which means that the
transition table is stored as an $ne \times ns$ array, where $ne$ and
$ns$ are the sizes of the alphabet  and state-set, respectively.
This is always the default, and is the fastest. It can be expensive on
space, however, particularly when the alphabet is large. If you run out
of space, or a program starts to swap heavily, then it may be worth trying
sparse storage.
\item[|-ip s|[<dr>]]
Store finite state automata in sparse format. This means that the
transitions from each state are stored as a sequence of edge-target
pairs. With large automata, with large alphabet (which means size more
than about 5 or 6), it normally requires significantly less space than
dense format. The '[<dr>]' option (dense rows) is a compromise.
Here <dr> should be a positive integer (something like 1000 might be a good
choice). The transitions from the first <dr> states are stored in dense
format, and the remainder in sparse format.
\item[|-op d|]
Automata are written to files in dense format. This is the default
for one-variable automata (such as the word acceptor in an automatic
group).
\item[|-op s|]
Automata are written to files in sparse format. This is the default
for two-variable automata (such as the multiplier in an automatic
group).
\end{description}
