\Chapter{The Automatic Coset System and Subgroup Presentation Package}

The aim of this package is firstly to calculate the finite state automata
associated with an automatic coset system for a suitable subgroup $H$ of a
short-lex automatic group $G$, and secondly to calculate a
presentation of $H$. At the end of a successful calculation, five automata
will be stored. These are the first and second word-difference machines, the
coset word-acceptor, and two versions of the general-multiplier for the coset
structure. The word-difference machines and one version of the multiplier
are midfa (multiple-initial-state deterministic automata). This means that
their transition tables are deterministic, but they may have more than one
initial states. The coset word-acceptor (which accepts the short-lex least
word that lies in each right coset of $H$ in $G$) and the other version of the
multiplier are standard deterministic automata.  The multiplier is a
two-variable automaton over the set of monoid generators of $G$ that accepts a
pair of words $(w_1,w_2)$ in these generators if and only if $w_1$ and $w_2$
are accepted by the coset word-acceptor, and the right cosets $Hw_1x$ and
$Hw_2$ are equal for some monoid generator $x$ of $G$. As is the case with the
general multiplier for an ordinary automatic structure, the success states
of the multiplier are labeled by the generators $x$.
Currently, the only reference for the theory of automatic coset systems is the
Ph.D. thesis of Ian Redfern \cite{Red93}. It is proved there that quasiconvex
subgroups of word-hyperbolic groups always have short-lex automatic coset
systems.

The resulting automata can be used for reducing words $w$ to the unique
minimal word $v$ in the group under the short-lex ordering, such that $Hv=Hw$.
In particular, this enables the generalised word-problem to be solved for the
subgroup $H$ of $G$. They can also be used for counting and enumerating the
accepted language.
See Sections "wordreduce -cos (automatic coset systems)", and
"fsacount and fsaenumerate (automatic coset systems)" for details.
(In fact the multiplier automaton is not needed for any of these processes,
but it forms part of the automatic coset system from a
theoretical viewpoint, so we regard it as part of the output of the
calculation.)

There are two possibilities for computing the automatic coset system.
The simplest is to use the program 'autcos', which is in fact a
Unix Bourne-shell script, which runs the C-programs involved,
and attempts to make a sensible choice of options.
The other possibility is to run the programs 'makecosfile' (with the '-sg'
option), 'kbprogcos\ -wd', 'gpmakefsa\ -cos', 'gpaxioms\ -cos' and possibly
'gpsubpres' individually, and to select the options oneself.
'kbprogcos -wd' runs the Knuth--Bendix process on the coset rewriting system
for the subgroup $H$ of $G$, and calculates the resulting word-differences
arising from the equations generated.

For the complete process to be successful, the
the set of all word-differences arising from these equations,
and the set of all words $v$ in $H$ that occur in the rewriting equations of
the form '[\_H'$w_1,v$'\_H'$w_2$']' must both be finite;
however, 'kbprogcos -wd' itself will normally run forever, generating
infinitely many equations, and so sensible halting criteria must be devised.
Clearly one wants to halt as soon as all of the
word-differences and words $v$ in $H$ have been found, if possible. Further
details are given in Section "kbprogcos -wd". 'gpmakefsa\ -cos' uses the
word-difference output by 'kbprogcos\ -wd' to compute the word-acceptor and
multiplier automata.
It performs some checks on these which can reveal if the set of
word-differences (or subgroup words) used was not in fact complete, and find
some of the missing ones. It can then try again with the extended sets of
word-differences. After this process completes successfully, the program
'gpaxioms\ -cos' performs the axiom-checking process, which proves the
correctness of the automata calculated.

If a presentation of the subgroup $H$ is required, then it can be computed
using the program 'gpsubpres' (see "gpsubpres"). Currently this will be on
a set of generators for $H$ determined by the program. (This is in fact
corresponds to the final set of initial states that occur in the midfa version
of the generalised multiplier.) It is hoped that it
will eventually be possible to compute such a presentation on the set
generators of $H$ originally specified by the user in the file defining $H$.
The presentation will be highly redundant, with multiple occurrences of each
relator and its cyclic conjugates. It is therefore output as a {\GAP}
definition of a finitely presented group, so that it can read in by {\GAP}
and simplified if required.

If the file containing the coset rewriting system is named
<groupname>'.'<cosame>, then all files created by the programs will have names
of form <groupname>'.'<cosname>'.'<suffix>, except for that containing the
presentation of $H$, which will be named <groupname>'.'<subname>'.pres'.

\Section{autcos}

'autcos  [-l] [-v] [-silent] [-diff1] [-f] [-p] [-pref <prefix>] <groupname>'\\
'| || || || || || || |[<subname>]'

Compute the finite state automata that constitute an automatic coset system,
for a suitable subgroup $H$ of a short-lex automatic group $G$.
Input is taken from the files <groupname> and <groupname>'.'<subname>.
As with 'makecosfile', the default for <subname> is 'sub'.
The first of these files should contain a declaration of a record defining a
rewriting-system for $G$, in the format described in Chapter "Introduction".
Since $G$ is a group $G$, all monoid generators must have
inverses listed explicitly. The second input file should contain a record
defining a subgroup $H$ of $G$ in the format described in Chapter
"Subgroup and Coset Files", and the 'subGeneratorNames' field must be present.
Output is to the files <groupname>'.'<cosname>'.midiff1',
<groupname>'.'<cosname>'.midiff2' (midfa word-difference machines),
<groupname>'.'<cosname>'.wa' (coset word-acceptor),
<groupname>'.'<cos-name>'.migm' and <groupname>'.'<cosname>'.gm'
(midfa genemral multiplier and deterministic general multiplier), and
possibly <groupname>'.'<subname>'.pres' (subgroup presentation), where
the string <cosname> is derived from <subname> by substituting
'cos' for 'sub' as described in Chapter "Subgroup and Coset Files".

*Options*\\
For a general description of the options '[-l]', '[-v]' and '[-silent]',
see Section
"Exit Status of Programs and Meanings of Some Options".
For greater flexibility in choice of options, run the programs
'makesubfile\ -sg', 'kbprogcos\ -wd', 'gpmakefsa\ -cos', 'gpaxioms\ -cos' and
'gpsubpres' individually, rather than using 'autcos'. 

\begin{description}
\item[|-l |]
This causes 'gpmakefsa\ -cos', 'gpaxioms\ -cos' and 'gpsubpres' to be run with
the '-l' option, which means large hash-tables.
However, '-l' also causes 'kbprogcos\ -wd' to be run
with larger parameters, and you are advised to use it only after you
have tried first without it, since it will cause easy examples to take
much longer to run.
\item[|-diff1|]
This causes 'gpmakefsa\ -cos' to be run with the '-diff1' option. See Section
"gpmakefsa -cos" for further details.
\item[|-f |] This causes 'gpmakefsa\ -cos' and 'gpaxioms\ -cos' to be run with
the '-f' option. See Sections "gpmakefsa -cos" and "gpaxioms -cos" for
further details. This is the option to choose if you need to save space,
and don\'t mind waiting a bit longer.
\item[|-p|] Calculate a presentation of the subgroup $H$. This is likely to be
the most time- and space-consuming part of the whole computation, and is not
done by default.
\item[|-pref| <prefix>] Name the finite presentation of the subgroup
$H$ that is output in {\GAP} format <prefix>, and its generators
<prefix>'1', <prefix>'2', etc. The default for <prefix> is '\_x'. 
\end{description}
\Section{kbprogcos -wd}
'kbprogcos -wd [-t <tidyint>] [-me <maxeqns>] [-ms <maxstates>]\
[-mwd <maxwdiffs>]'\\
'| || || || || || || |[-hf <halting\_factor>] [-mt <min\_time>]\
[-rk <minlen> <mineqns>]'\\
'| || || || || || || |[-v] [-silent] [-cn <confnum>] <groupname> [<cosname>]'

Some of these options are of course the same as for when 'kbprogcos' is being
used as a stand-alone Knuth--Bendix program for cosets of subgroups --
see Section "kbprogcos". The default value of <cosname> is 'cos'.

'kbprogcos\ -wd' takes its input from the file <groupname>.<cosname>,
which should contain a declaration of a record defining a coset
rewriting-system for a subgroup $H$ of a group $G$, in the format described in
Chapter "Subgroup and Coset Files". See also Section "kbprogcos", for a
definition of a coset rewriting system. To obtain meaningful results,
$H$-generators must be present in the rewriting system.
The ordering must be |"wreathprod"|, and all $H$-generators  and all
$G$-generators must have the same levels $l_H$ and $l_G$, with $l_H \< l_G$.
Since $G$ and $H$ must both be groups, all $G$-generators and all
$H$-generators must have inverses, and the inverse function must be involutory.
The separator symbol '\_H' should not, of course, have an inverse.
This input file will normally be generated by running 'makecosfile' with the
'-sg' option.

The Knuth--Bendix completion process is carried out on the coset rewriting
system.
However, unlike in the standalone usage of 'kbprogcos', the extended set of
equations and the reduction automaton are not output. Instead, the two
word-difference automata arising from the equations are output when the program
halts. These are printed to the two files <groupname>'.midiff1' and
<groupname>'.midiff2'. The difference between them is that the first automaton
contains only those word-differences and transitions that arise from the
equations themselves. For the second automaton, the set of word-differences
arising from the equations is closed under inversion, and all possible
transitions are included. So the second automaton has both more states and
generally more transitions per state than the first. For their uses, see
Section "gpmakefsa -cos" below.

These word-difference automata are midfa; that is they have deterministic
transition tables, but multiple initial states. They are two-variable automata
in the $G$-generators only. The equations in the $G$-generators are
handled as they are in 'kbprog -wd'. The coset equations
'[\_H'$w_1,v$'\_H'$w_2$']', where $w_1$ and $w_2$ are words in the
$G$-generators and $v$ is a word in the $H$-generators, are handled slightly
differently. The word $v$ is rewritten as a word in the $G$-generators, and
then becomes an initial state of the word-difference machines, which leads
to success on reading the pair of $G$-words '['$w_1,w_2$']'. The equations
in the $H$-generators only are not used. 

As with 'kbprog -wd', this program will not usually complete with a
confluent set of equations, but will continue indefinitely, and so halting
criteria have to be chosen. This can only be usefully done if the sets of
word-differences and initial states arising from the equations are both
finite. This is known theoretically to be the case for quasiconvex subgroups
of word-hyperbolic groups, but fortunately it appears to be true also
for many other subgroups of short-lex automatic groups.
The general idea is to wait until these sets appears to have become constant,
and then stop.

The methods available for interrupting 'kbprogcos -wd', or for specifying
halting criteria with command-line options, are essentially the same as for
'kbprog -wd', and the reader should refer to Section "kbprog -wd" for guidance.
The other options are also the same as there.

*Exit status*\\
The exit status is 0 if 'kbprog' completes with a confluent set of equations,
or if it halts because the condition in the '-hf <halting\_factor>' option
has been fulfilled,
2 if it halts and outputs because some other limit has
been exceeded, or it has received an interrupt signal, and 1 if it exits
without output, with an error message.
This information is used by the shell-script 'autcos'.

\Section{gpmakefsa -cos}

'gpmakefsa  -cos [-diff1/-diff2] [-me <maxeqns>] [-mwd <maxwdiffs>] [-l]'\\
'| || || || || || || || || || |[-ip d/s[dr]] [-opwa d/s] [-opgm d/s]\
[-v] [-silent]'\\
'| || || || || || || || || || |<groupname> [<cosname>]'

Construct the coset word-acceptor and general multiplier finite state automata
for the coset automatic system, of which the rewriting-system defining
the group and subgroup is in the file <groupname>.<cosname>.
The default value of <cosname> is 'cos'.
It assumes that 'kbprogcos\ -wd' has already been run on the system.
Input is from <groupname>.<cosname>'.midiff2' and, if
the '-diff1' option is called, also from <groupname>.<cosname>'.midiff1'. The
coset word-acceptor is output to <groupname>.<cosname>'.wa' and the general
coset multiplier to <groupname>.<cosname>'.migm' and
<groupname>.<cosname>'.gm' in its midfa and deterministic versions,
respectively.  Certain correctness tests are carried out on the
constructed automata. If they fail, then new word-differences will be
found and <groupname>.<cosname>'.midiff2' (and possibly also
<groupname>.<cosname>'.midiff1')
will be updated, and the multiplier (and possibly the word-acceptor)
will then be re-calculated.

There are programs available which construct these automata individually,
and also one which performs the correctness test, but it is unlikely that
you will want to use them. They are mentioned briefly in
Section "Other coset automata programs".

The choice of input, as controlled by the '-diff1' and '-diff2'
options ('-diff2' is the default) is essentially the same as
for 'gpmakefsa' without the '-cos' option; see Section "gpmakefsa".
The correctness check on the multiplier is also similar. The
midfa version of the multiplier is constructed first, and the
deterministic version is constructed from this, and used for the
correctness test. Thus both versions need to be constructed for
each call of the correctness test.
All other options are as for 'gpmakefsa', but note that the
'-f' option is not available in the cosets version.

\Section{gpaxioms -cos}

'gpaxioms [-cos] [-ip d/s[dr]] [-op d/s] [-silent] [-v] [-l] [-n]'\\
'| || || || || || || || || || |<groupname> [<cosname>]'

This program performs the axiom-checking process on the coset word-acceptor and
general multiplier of the automatic coset system, of which the
rewriting-system defining the group and subgroup is in the file
<groupname>.<cosname>. The default value of <cosname> is 'cos'.
It assumes that 'kbprogcos\ -wd' and 'gpmakefsa\ -cos' have already been run
on the system.
It takes its input from <groupname> and <groupname>.<cosname>'.gm'. 
There is no output to files (although plenty of intermediate files are
created and later removed during the course of the calculation).

If successful, there will be no output apart from routine reports, and the exit
status will be 0. If unsuccessful, a message will be printed to 'stdout'
reporting that a relation test failed for one of the group relations, and
the exit status will be 2.

The |-n| option is the same as in Section "gpaxioms".
The other options are all standard, and described in Section 
"Exit Status of Programs and Meanings of Some Options".
\Section{gpmimult}

'gpmimult [-ip d/s] [-op d/s] [-silent] [-v] [-l] [-pref <prefix>]'\\
'| || || || || || || || || || |<groupname> [<cosname>]'

This calculates the individual midfa coset multiplier automata, for the monoid
generators of the group, of which the rewriting-system
defining the group and subgroup is in the file <groupname>.<cosname>.
The default value of <cosname> is 'cos'.
It assumes that 'autcos' (or the programs 'kbprogcos\ -wd', 'gpmakefsa\ -cos'
and 'gpaxioms\ -cos') have already been run successfully on the system.
Input is from <groupname>.<cosname>.'migm', and output is to
<groupname>.<cosname>'.mim'<n>
(one file for each multiplier), for $n = 1, \ldots , ng+1$, where $ng$ is
the number of monoid generators of the group. The final multiplier is
the coset equality multiplier, which accepts $(u,v)$ if and only if
$u = v$ and $u$ is accepted by the coset word-acceptor.

The labels for the initial states of these multipliers correspond
precisely to the generators of $H$ on which a presentation of $H$
can be calculated by the program 'gpsubpres' (see below). They are
described as words in the $G$-generators in the file
<groupname>.<cosname>.'migm', but in the individual multiplier
files, they are given new and distinct names of the form
<prefix>'1', <prefix>'2', etc.
The string <prefix> can be set with the '-pref' option, the
default being '\_x'. All other options are standard.

\Section{gpsubpres}
'gpsubpres [-ip d/s] [-op d/s] [-silent] [-v] [-l] [-pref <prefix>]'\\
'| || || || || || || || || || |<groupname> [<subname>]'

Calculate a presentation of the subgroup $H$ of the group $G$ as defined
by the rewriting system for $G$ in the file <groupname> and the
definition of the subgroup $H$ in the file <groupname>.<subname>.
Here <cosname> is derived from <subname> by substituting
'cos' for 'sub' as described in Chapter "Subgroup and Coset Files".
It assumes that 'autcos' (or the programs 'makesubfile\ -sg', 'kbprogcos\ -wd',
'gpmakefsa\ -cos' and 'gpaxioms\ -cos') have already been run successfully on
$G$ and $H$.
Input is from <groupname> and <groupname>.<cosname>'.migm'
(where <cosname> is derived from <subname> as described in
Chapter "Subgroup and Coset Files" or Section "autcos"), and output
is to the file <groupname>.<subname>'.pres'.

The output presentation, which will usually contain many superfluous and
repeated relators, is a {\GAP} definition of a finitely presented group, which
can be read in by {\GAP} and simplified if required. The name of the group in
this definition is <prefix>, and its generators are named <prefix>'1',
<prefix>'2', etc.  The string <prefix> is equal to '\_x' by default, but can be
set by using the '-pref' option.  The other options are the same as for
'gpaxioms'.

\Section{wordreduce -cos (automatic coset systems)}
'wordreduce [-cos] [-kbprog/-diff1/-diff2] [-mrl <maxreducelen>]'\\
'| || || || || || || || || || || |<groupname> [<cosname>]'

This program can be used either on the output of 'kbprogcos' or on the output
of the automatic coset system package. The '-kbprog' option refers to the former
use, which is described in Section "wordreduce -cos (Knuth--Bendix)".
The '-kbprog' usage is considerably quicker, but it is only guaranteed
accurate when a finite confluent set of equations has been calculated. 
The automatic coset system programs are normally only used when such a set
cannot be found, in which case the usage here is the only
accurate one available.
The '-kbprog' usage is the default if the file <groupname>'.kbprog' is present.
To be certain of using the intended algorithm, call one of the flags
'-diff1', '-diff2' explicitly.
If <groupname>.<cosname>'.kbprog' is not present, then input will be from
<groupname>.<cosname>'.midiff2' by default, and otherwise from
<groupname>.<cosname>'.midiff1'.

It is assumed that the file <groupname>.<cosname> contains a coset
rewriting-system for a subgroup $H$ of a short-lex automatic group $G$,
and that 'autcos' (or the programs 'kbprogcos\ -wd', 'gpmakefsa\ -cos'
and 'gpaxioms\ -cos') have already been run successfully on the system.
The '-diff1' option should only be used for input if  'autcos' or
'gpmakefsa\ -cos' was run successfully with the '-diff1' option, in which
case it will be the most efficient. (Otherwise you might get wrong answers.)

The words to be reduced by 'wordreduce\ -cos' must either be in the
$G$-generators of the coset system alone, in which case the reduction
will be to the short-lex minimal representative of the word in $G$, or
they must have the form $w_1$'\_H'$w_2$, where $w_1$ and $w_2$ are both words
in the $G$-generators, in which case the reduction will be to a word
$w_1^\prime$'\_H'$w_2^\prime$, where $w_1w_2$ and $w_1^\prime w_2^\prime$ are
equal elements in $G$, and $w_2^\prime$ is the short-lex least word that
represents an element of the coset $Hw_2$.  It can therefore be used to solve
the membership problem for the subgroup $H$ of $G$.
Note that the usage is not quite the same as in Section
"wordreduce -cos (Knuth--Bendix)", since the names for the $H$-generators
cannot be used.

The option '-mrl\ <maxreducelen>' puts a maximum length on the words to
be reduced. The default is 32767.

\Section{fsacount and fsaenumerate (automatic coset systems)}

If 'autcos' (or the programs 'kbprogcos\ -wd', 'gpmakefsa\ -cos'
and 'gpaxioms\ -cos') have already been run successfully on the 
coset rewriting system for the subgroup $H$ of the group $G$
in the file <groupname>.<cosname>, then running
'fsacount <groupname>.<cosname>.wa'
or 'fsaenumerate <min> <max> <groupname>.<cosname>.wa'
will calculate the index of $H$ in $G$, or enumerate words that are the
short-lex least representatives of the cosets of $H$ in $G$, and
have lengths between <min> and <max>.
For description of options, see Section
"Exit Status of Programs and Meanings of Some Options".
