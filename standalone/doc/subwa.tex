\Chapter{Creating Subgroup Word Acceptors}
\Section{Subgroup word acceptors}
The programs described in this chapter are for creating word-acceptors for
suitable subgroups $H$ of short-lex automatic groups $G$. Such a
word-acceptor is a finite state automaton with alphabet equal to the
monoid generating set for $G$, which accepts precisely those words that lie
in $H$ and are accepted by the word-acceptor for the short-lex automatic
structure of $G$. Thus they accept a unique word for each element of $H$.
An arbitrary word in the $G$-generators can then be tested for membership in $H$
by first reducing to its $G$-normal form (using 'wordreduce') and then
testing for acceptance by the word-acceptor for $H$. Thus the membership
problem (that is the generalized word problem) can be solved for $H$.

Theoretically, if $G$ is short-lex automatic, and its automatic structure
has been computed using 'autgroup' (or its constituents), then this method
will work precisely when $H$ is a quasiconvex subgroup of $G$. The algorithm
used consists of two parts, the construction of a candidate $W_H$ for the
word-acceptor, and a correctness verification. In case of failure of the
second part, one or more $G$-reduced words are calculated that lie in $H$
but are not accepted by $W_H$, and these can be used when the
construction part is repeated. Thus the two parts of the procedure are run
alternately until the correctness test succeeds. The method is based
roughly on that described by Ilya Karpovich in \cite{Kar94}. The correctness
testing part is identical to that described there, but the construction part
uses Knuth-Bendix based methods, rather than Todd-Coxeter coset enumeration
(which was suggested by Karpovich), since this is more in keeping with the
{\KBMAG} package as a whole.

The user can either run the program 'gpsubwa' (described in the following
section), which is a shell script that calls the two component programs
repeatedly until the correctness test is passed, or alternatively these
two components 'gpmakesubwa' and 'gpchecksubwa' (described in the remaining
sections of the chapter) can be run directly by the user. This allows a
slightly more flexible choice of options, but does not appear to be really
necessary in most examples. In fact, in the examples supplied in the
{\KBMAG} 'subgp\_data' directory, only 'l28.sub' fails to pass the
correctness test first time.

In either case, before running either 'gpsubwa' or 'gpmakesubwa',
the user must first run 'autgroup' or its constituents
(see Chapter "The Automatic Groups Package") on the group $G$, and must
provide a means for performing coset reduction of words <w> in the
$G$-generators to their short-lex least representative word <v> with
$Hw = Hv$. There are two possible ways of achieving this. The first is
to run 'autcos' (or its constituents) on the subgroup $H$ of $G$, as
described in Chapter
"The Automatic Coset System and Subgroup Presentation Package".
If successful, this assures correct coset reduction for all words <w>.
However, this may be too time-consuming, or even impossible, in
some examples. In general, it is sufficient to run 'kbprogcos' (see
Section "kbprogcos") on the cosets of $H$ in $G$ for a sufficiently
long time to enable the coset reduction of the required words to
be computed accurately using the reduction automaton that is output
by 'kbprogcos'. Of course the user has no theoretical means of
knowing how long this will be, and 'kbprogcos' will not normally
complete naturally. In practice this does not normally seem to be a problem,
however, and if 'gpsubwa' completes successfully, then the results are
theoretically guaranteed to be correct, irrespective of which
coset reduction method was used. Of course, if 'kbprogcos' had not
been run for long enough, then 'gpsubwa' would never complete, or would exit
abnormally with an error message containing the phrase
|error tracing word|.  If, in a particular example, 'gpsubwa' appears to be
looping indefinitely, or it exits with such a message, then the user should try
re-running 'kbprogcos' for longer than before.


\Section{gpsubwa}

'gpsubwa [-diff1/-diff1c] [-diff1cos/-diff2cos] [-l] [-v] [-silent] [-f]'\\
'| || || || || || || || |<groupname> [<subname>]'

'gpsubwa' attempts to compute a subgroup word-acceptor for the subgroup $H$ of
the short-lex automatic group $G$, where the rewriting system for $G$ is
defined in <groupname>, and the generators for $H$ are defined in the file,
<groupname>.<subname>, where <subname> defaults to 'sub'.
(See Chapter "Subgroup and Coset Files" for information on the format of
the latter file.) The computed automaton is output to the file
<groupname>.<subname>'.wa'.

'gpsubwa' requires the word-acceptor and general multiplier for the short-lex
automatic structure of $G$, which it inputs from the files <groupname>'.wa'
and <groupname>'.gm'.  These need to be computed
first by running 'autgroup' or its constituents. It also requires
word-reduction automata for $G$ and for cosets of $H$ in $G$, as described
above. These are input, respectively,  from <groupname>'.diff2' and
<groupname>.<cosname>'.kbprog' by default, but these defaults may be changed
by using the appropriate options (see below). Here <cosname> is derived
from <subname> by substituting the string 'cos' for 'sub' as described in
Chapter "Subgroup and Coset Files".

'gpsubwa' is a Bourne-shell script that runs the two programs 'gpmakesubwa'
and 'gpchecksubwa', documented in the following two sections, alternately.

*Options*\\
\begin{description}
\item[|-diff1/-diff1c|] Take the input automaton for word-reduction in $G$
from <groupname>'.diff1' or <groupname>'.diff1c', rather than from
<groupname.>'diff2'.
\item[|-diff1cos/-diff2cos|] Take the input automaton for coset word-reduction
of words in $G$ as coset representatives of $H$ in $G$ from
<groupname.cosname>'.diff1' or <groupname.cosname>'.diff2', rather than from
<groupname>.<cosname>'.kbprog'. These require 'autcos' or its
constituents (see Chapter 
"The Automatic Coset System and Subgroup Presentation Package")
to have been run first on the subgroup $H$ of $G$.
\item[|-f |] Save space where possible (at the cost of increased cpu-time)
when running the program 'gpchecksubwa', by calling its options
'-ip s' and '-f' (see below).
\end{description}
The remaining options are standard.

\Section{gpmakesubwa}

'gpmakesubwa [-w] [-diff1/-diff2/-diff1c] [-kbprogcos/-diff1cos/-diff2cos]'\\
'| || || || || || || || || || || || |[-mrl <maxreducelen>] [-nc nochange]\
[-l] [-v] [-silent]'\\
'| || || || || || || || || || || || |[-ms <maxstates>] <groupname>\
[<subname>]'

'gpmakesubwa' constructs a candidate $W_H$ for the subgroup word-acceptor
for the subgroup $H$ of the short-lex automatic group $G$. This is the first
of the two programs run by the Bourne-shell script 'gpsubwa' (see above).
Its input and output files, and several of the options are the same as
described above for 'gpsubwa'. The additional options are as follows.

*Options*\\
\begin{description}
\item[|-w |] This must be used if 'gpmakesubwa' and 'gpchecksubwa' have already
been run on this example, and 'gpchecksubwa' has reported that the
current candidate word-acceptor, $W_H$, constructed by 'gpmakesubwa' is
incorrect. 'gpchecksubwa' will then have output some $G$-reduced words that
lie in $H$ but are not accepted by $W_H$ to the file
<groupname.subname>'.words'.  These words are then read in by 'gpmakesubwa',
and it will ensure that they are accepted by the next candidate constructed.
\item[|-nc| <nochange>]| |\newline
$W_H$ is computed by considering $G$-reduced words
that lie in $H$, by repeatedly multiplying the generators of $H$ and
any additional words output by 'gpchecksubwa' together, and altering
$W_H$ if necessary so that it accepts these words.
When <nochange> such words have been considered without causing any
change in $W_H$, the program halts and outputs $W_H$.
The initial default is 64, but this is increased to a
maximum of 4096 if additional words output by 'gpchecksubwa' are used.
It can be made even higher if required by using this option.
\item[|-ms| <maxstates>]| |\newline
This resets the maximum number of states allowed in the candidate subgroup
word-acceptor from the default (32767) to <maxstates>.
Again, it is unlikely for this to be necessary.
\item[|-mrl| <maxreducelen>]| |\newline
This resets the maximul length of words allowed in the program from the default
(4095) to <maxreducelen>. It is unlikely for this to be necessary.
\end{description}

\Section{gpchecksubwa}

'gpchecksubwa [-ip d/s[<dr>]] [-op d/s] [-l] [-v] [-silent] [-f]\
[-m <maxwords>]'\\
'| || || || || || || || || || || || || |<groupname> [<subname>]'

'gpchecksubwa' reads in a candidate word acceptor $W_H$ produced by
'gpmakesubwa' from the file <groupname.subname>'.wa', and checks it for
correctness. If it finds it is correct, then it exits with exit-status 0.
It it finds it is incorrect, then it exits with status 2, and also
outputs a list of $G$-reduced words that lie in $H$ but are not accepted
by $W_H$ to the file <groupname.subname>'.words'.
(As usual, exit status 1 is used when some kind of fatal error, such as
missing input file, or syntax error in input file occurs.)
The general multiplier for the short-lex automatic structure of $G$ is
required, and is input from <groupname>'.gm'. A number of temporary
multiplier files for $G$, like those produced by 'gpaxioms' (see
Section "gpaxioms"), are computed and output, but are removed before
the program exits (assuming it exits normally).

*Options*\\
These are all standard, except for the following.
\begin{description}
\item[|-f |] This is the same as for 'gpmakefsa' or 'gpaxioms'. See Sections
"gpmakefsa" and "gpaxioms".
\item[|-m| <maxwords>]| |\newline
Abort after finding <maxwords> $G$-reduced words that lie in $H$ but are
not accepted by $W_H$. The default is 2048.
\end{description}
