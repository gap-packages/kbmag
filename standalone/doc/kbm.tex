The program 'kbprog' has zillions of options. Only those that are relevant
to its use as a stand-alone Knuth--Bendix program on monoids are listed here.
Those pertaining to its use as part of the the automatic groups package are
dealt with in Chapter "The Automatic Groups Package".

'kbprog' takes its input from the file <monoidname>, which should contain a
declaration of a record defining a rewriting-system, in the format described
in Chapter "Introduction". Output is to two files, <monoidname>'.kbprog' and
<monoidname>'.reduce'. The first contains an updated declaration of the
original rewriting-system, in which the |equations|\ field contains the
list of all reduction equations found so far. If the process has completed,
and the system is now confluent, then a new field |isConfluent| will
have appeared, and will be set equal to 'true'. In the equations,
the left hand side will always be greater than the right hand side in the
ordering on strings that is being used (see options below).
The second file contains a finite state automaton,
which can be used, together with the contents of the first file,
to reduce words in the monoid generators. This is done using the
program 'wordreduce' (see Section "wordreduce (Knuth--Bendix)").

If the system is confluent, then these reductions will be to the unique
minimal word under the ordering being used that is equal in the monoid to the
input word. We can therefore solve the word problem in the monoid. In this
case, the language of the automaton will be this set of minimal words.
If the monoid is finite, then its order can be determined by using the
program 'fsacount' (see Section "fsacount (Knuth--Bendix)").
In any case, the words accepted
can be enumerated up to a specified length with the program 'fsaenumerate'
(see Section "fsaenumerate (Knuth--Bendix)").

The Knuth--Bendix process will more often than not run forever by default,
and so some conditions have to be specified under which it will stop.
These take the form of limits that are placed on certain variables,
such as the number of reduction equations. 
These limits can be given values by the user, either by use of command-line
options, or with a field setting in the input file
(and the former takes priority in case of conflict).
Wherever possible, if the program halts because one of the limits is exceeded,
it will print a message informing the user what has happened,
and output its current set of equations and the reduction machine.

It is also possible to halt the program interactively at any stage, by
sending it a single interrupt signal (which usually means typing Control-C).
If you do this, then it will halt and output at the next convenient
opportunity, and so you may have to wait a while. If you send two interrupt
signals, then it will abort immediately without outputting.

*Options*\\
For most of the command-line options, the same effect can also be achieved by 
use of a corresponding field setting in the input file. In case of conflict,
the convention is that options set via the command-line override the setting in
the input file. Note, however,  that the two most complicated ordering options,
the weighted-lex ordering and the wreath-product ordering, can only
be sensibly set within the input file, because they require the generators
to be given weights and levels, respectively, in these two cases.
See the options '-wtlex' and '-wreath' below, for further details.
\begin{description}
\item[|-r |]
This means resume after a previous run in which the output set of equations
was not confluent. Input will be taken from <monoidname>|.kbprog| instead of
from <monoidname>. The output will go to the same place, so the old
<monoidname>|.kbprog| will be overwritten.
It is useful if the program halted on a previous run due to some limit
being exceeded, and you wish to resume with a higher limit.
\item[|-ro |]
This is similar to |-r|, but in addition to taking the 
input from <monoidname>|.kbprog|, the original equations, in the file
<monoidname>, will also be read in and re-inserted at the end of the list.
This is sometimes necessary or advisable, if on the previous run not all
equations have been output, or some have been rejected because they were too
long. In that situation, there is a danger that the monoid defined by
the equations may have changed, and it can always be reset to the original
by re-inserting the original equations.
The output will go to the usual place, so the old
<monoidname>|.kbprog| will be overwritten.
\item[|-t| <tidyint>] | |\newline
After finding <tidyint> new reduction equations, the program interrupts
the main process of looking for overlaps, to tidy up the existing set of
equations. This means eliminating any redundant equations and performing
some reductions on their left and right hand sides to make the set as
compact as possible. (The point is that equations discovered later often
make older equations redundant or too long.) The default value of
<tidyint> is 100, and it can be altered with this option. Different values
work better on different examples. This parameter can also be set by
including a |tidyint| field in the input file.
\item[|-me| <maxeqns>] | |\newline
This puts a limit on the number of reduction equations.
The default is 32767.
If exceeded, the program will stop and output the current equations.
It can also be set as the field 'maxeqns' in the input file.
\item[|-ms| <maxstates>] | |\newline
This is less important, and not usually needed.
It sets a limit on the number of states of the finite state automaton
used for word reduction.
If exceeded, the program will stop and output the current equations.
By default, there is no limit, and the space allocated is increased
dynamically as required. Occasionally, the space required can increase too fast
for the program to cope; in this case, you can try setting a higher limit.
It can also be set as the field 'maxstates' in the input file.
The space needed for the reduction automaton can also be restricted by
using the |-rk| (Rabin-Karp reduction) option - see below.
\item[|-mrl| <maxreducelen>] | |\newline
Again, this is not needed very often. It is the maximum allowed length that
a word can reach during reduction. By default it is 32767.
If exceeded, the program is forced to abort without outputting.
It is only likely to be exceeded if you are using a recursive ordering on words.
It can also be set as the field 'maxreducelen' in the input file.
\item[|-mo| <maxoverlaplen>] | |\newline
If this is used, then only overlaps of total length at most <maxoverlap>
are processed.
Of course this may cause the overlap search to complete on a set
of equations that is not confluent. If this happens, you can always resume
with a higher (or no) limit.
This parameter can also be set as the field 'maxoverlaplen' in the input file.
\item[|-mlr| <maxlenleft> <maxlenright>] | |\newline
If this is used, then only equations in which the left and right hand sides
have lengths at most <maxlenleft> and <maxlenright>, respectively, are
kept. Of course this may cause the overlap search to complete on a set
of equations that is not confluent. If this happens, you can always resume
with higher limits. In some examples, particularly those involving
collapse (i.e. a large intermediate set of equations, which later simplifies
to a small set), it can result in a confluent set being found much more
quickly. It is most often useful when using a recursive ordering on words. 
Another danger with this option is that sometimes discarding equations can
result in information being lost, and the monoid defined by the equations
changes. If this may have happened, a warning message will be printed at
the end. In this case, the recommended policy is to re-run with the 
|-ro| option. In later versions it will be possible to do this automatically.
This option can also be set as a field in the input file.
The syntax for this is

'maxstoredlen \:= [<maxlenleft>,<maxlenright>]'
\item[|-sort| <maxoplen>] | |\newline
This causes equations to be output in order of increasing length of their
left hand sides, rather than the default, which is to output them in the
order in which they were found. <maxoplen> should be a non-negative integer.
If it is positive, then only equations with left hand sides having length
at most <maxoplen> are output. If it is zero, then all equations are output.
Of course, if <maxoplen> is positive, there is a danger that the monoid
defined by the output equations may be different from the original.
In this case, the safest thing is to edit the output file,
re-insert the original relations and re-run (possibly with higher length
limits). In later versions it will be possible to do this automatically.
This option can also be set as fields in the input file.
The syntax for this is

'sorteqns \:= true, maxoplen \:= <maxoplen>'
\item[|-rk| <minlen> <mineqns>] | |\newline
Use the Rabin-Karp algorithm for word-reduction on words having length at least
<minlen>, provided that there are at least <mineqns> equations.
This uses less space than the default reduction automaton, but it is
distinctly slower, so it should only be used when you are seriously short of
memory.
In fact, if the program halts and outputs for any reason, then
the full reduction automaton is output as normal, so it is only really
useful for examples in which collapse occurs - i.e. at some intermediate
stage of the calculation there is a very large set of equations, which later
reduces to a much smaller confluent set. However, this situation is not
uncommon when analysing pathological presentations of finite groups, and
this is one situation where the performance of the Knuth-Bendix algorithm can
be superior to that of Todd-Coxeter coset enumeration.
The best settings for <minlen> and <mineqns> vary from example to
example - generally speaking, the smaller <minlen> is, the slower things
will be, so set it as high as possible subject to not running out of memory.
<mineqns> should be set higher than you expect the final number of
equations to be.
This option can also be set as a field in the input file.
The syntax for this is

'RabinKarp \:= [<minlen>,<mineqns>]'
\item[|-v |]
The verbose option. Regular reports on the current number of equations, etc. are
output. This is to be recommended for interactive use.
This parameter can also be set by including a |verbose| field in the input
file, and setting it equal to 'true'.
\item[|-ve |]
The verbose-equations option. In addition to the output produced under
|-v|, each new equation is printed as it is found, together with the
numbers of the two equations for which the overlap gave rise to this
new equation. This can be useful in small examples for reconstructing
the derivation of a particular equation in the monoid.
\item[|-silent|]
There is no output at all to 'stdout'. In particular, the reason for
halting will not be printed.
This parameter can also be set by including a |silent| field in the input
file, and setting it equal to 'true'.
\item[|-lex|]
Use the short-lex ordering on strings. This is the default ordering.
Shorter words come before longer, and for words of equal length,
lexicographical ordering is used, using the given ordering of the generators.
It can also be set as a field in the input file. The syntax for this is

|ordering := "shortlex"|
\item[|-rec, -rtrec|]
Use a recursive ordering on strings. 
There are various ways to define this. Perhaps the quickest is as
follows. Let $u$ and $v$ be strings in the generators.
If one of $u$ and $v$, say $v$,  is empty, then $u \ge v$.
Otherwise, let $u=u^\prime a$ and $v=v^\prime b$,
where $a$ and $b$ are generators.
Then $u > v$ if and only if one of the following holds\:
\begin {description}
\item[(i)] $a = b$ and $u^\prime > v^\prime$;
\item[(ii)] $a > b$ and $u > v^\prime$;
\item[(ii)] $b > a$ and $u^\prime > v$.
\end {description}
This is the ordering used for the |-rec| option. The |-rtrec| option is
similar, but with $u=au^\prime$ and $v=bv^\prime$;
occasionally one or the other runs
significantly quicker, but usually they perform similarly.
It can also be set as a field in the input file. The syntax for this is

|ordering := "recursive"| \hspace{1cm} or  \hspace{1cm}
|ordering := "rt_recursive"|

\item[|-wtlex|]
Use a weighted-lex ordering.
Although this option does exist as a command-line option, it will usually
be specified within the input file, because each generator needs to be
assigned a weight, which should be a non-negative integer. The \'\'length\"
of words in the generators is then computed by adding up the weights of the
generators in the words. Otherwise, ordering is as for short-lex.
An example of assignments within the the input file is:

|ordering := "wtlex", weight := [2,1,6,3,0],|

which assigns weights 2,1,6,3 and 0 to the generators. The length of the
list of weights must be equal to the number of generators. The assignment
of the 'weight' field must come after the 'generatorOrder' field.
\item[|-wreath|]
Use a wreath-product ordering.
Although this option does exist as a command-line option, it will usually
be specified within the input file, because each generator needs to be
assigned a level, which should be a non-negative integer.
In this ordering, two strings involving generators of the same level are
ordered using short-lex, but all strings in generators of a higher level are
larger than those involving generators of a lower level. That is not a
complete definition; one can be found  on pages 46 -- 50 of \cite{Sims94}.
Note that the recursive ordering is the special case in which the level
of generator number $i$ is $i$.
An example of assignments within the the input file is:

|ordering := "wreathprod", level := [4,3,2,1],|

which assigns levels 4,3,2 and 1 to the generators. The length of the
list of levels must be equal to the number of generators. The assignment
of the 'level' field must come after the 'generatorOrder' field.
\item[|-cn| <confnum>] | |\newline
If <confnum> overlaps are processed and no new equations are discovered, then
the overlap searching process is interrupted, and a fast check for
confluence performed on the existing set of equations.
The default value is 500. Doing this too often wastes time, but doing it
at the right moment can also save a lot of time. Sometimes a particular
value works very well for a particular example, but it is difficult
to predict this in advance! If <confnum> is set to 0, then the fast
confluence check is performed only when the search for overlaps is
complete.
It can also be set as the field 'confnum' in the input file.
\end{description}

*Exit status*\\
The exit status is 0 if 'kbprog' completes with a confluent set of equations,
2 if it halts and outputs a non-confluent set because some limit has
been exceeded, or it has received an interrupt signal, and 1 if it exits
without output, with an error message.

\Section{wordreduce (Knuth--Bendix)}
'wordreduce  [-kbprog/-diff1/-diff2/-diffc] [-mrl <maxreducelen>] monoidname' 

This program can be used either on the output of 'kbprog' or on the output
of the automata package. The '[-diff<x>]' options refer to the latter use,
which is described in Section
"wordreduce (automatic groups)".
The former use is the default if
the file <monoidname>'.kbprog' is present; to be certain, call the
'-kbprog' flag explicitly.

'wordreduce' reduces words using the output of a run of 'kbprog', which is
read from the files <monoidname>'.kbprog' and <monoidname>'.reduce'.
The reductions will always be
correct in the sense that the output word will represent the same group
element as the input word. If the system of equations in <monoidname>'.kbprog'
is confluent, then the reduction will be to the minimal word that represents
the group element under the ordering on strings of generators that was used
by 'kbprog'. It can therefore be used to solve the word problem in the
monoid. If the system is not confluent, then there will be some pairs of words 
which are equal in the monoid, but which reduce to distinct words, and
so this program cannot be used to solve the word problem.
'wordreduce' prompts for the words to be input at the terminal.

The option '-mrl\ <maxreducelen>' puts a maximum length on the words to
be reduced. The default is 32767.

\Section{fsacount (Knuth--Bendix)}

'fsacount  [-ip d/s] [-silent] [-v] [<filename>]'

This is one of the finite state automata functions. See Chapter 
"Programs for Manipulating Finite State Automata" for the complete list.
The size of the accepted language is counted, and the answer (which may
of course be infinite) is output to 'stdout'. Input is from <filename> if
the optional argument is present, and otherwise from 'stdin', and it
should be a declaration of a finite state automaton record.
If 'kbprog' outputs a confluent set of equations for the monoid in the file
<monoidname>, then running 'fsacount <monoidname>.reduce'
will calculate the size of the monoid.
For description of options, see Section
"Exit Status of Programs and Meanings of Some Options".

\Section{fsaenumerate (Knuth--Bendix)}

'fsaenumerate  [-ip d/s] [-bfs/-dfs] <min> <max> [<filename>]' 

This is one of the finite state automata functions. See Chapter 
"Programs for Manipulating Finite State Automata" for the complete list.
Input is from <filename> if
the optional argument is present, and otherwise from 'stdin', and it
should be a declaration of a finite state automaton record.
<min> and <max> should be non-negative integers with <min> $\le$ <max>.
The words in the accepted language having lengths at least <min> and at
most <max> are enumerated, and output as a list of words to
'stdout' or to the file <filename>'.enumerate'.
If 'kbprog' outputs a confluent set of equations for the monoid in the file
<monoidname>, then running 'fsaenumerate <min> <max> <monoidname>.reduce'
will produce a list of elements in the monoid of which the reduced 
word representatives have lengths between <min> and <max>.
If the option '-dfs' (depth-first search - the default) is called,
then the words
in the list will be in lexicographical order, whereas with '-bfs'
(breadth-first-search), they will be in order of increasing length, and in
lexicographical order for each individual length (i.e. in short-lex order).
Depth-first-search is marginally quicker.
For description of other options, see Section
"Exit Status of Programs and Meanings of Some Options".
\Section{Examples (Knuth--Bendix)}

In this section, we mention some of the examples in the 'kb\_data' directory.
These can usefully be used as test examples, and some of them have been
included to demonstrate particular features.

The 'degen' examples  are all of the trivial group. Note, in particular,
'degen4a', 'degen4b' and 'degen4c'. These are the first three of an
infinite sequences of increasingly complicated presentations of the
trivial group, due to B.H. Neumann. 'kbprog' will run quite quickly on
'degen4b' (although no current Todd-Coxeter program will complete on this
presentation), but it does not appear to complete on 'degen4c'.

The example 'ab2' is the free abelian group on two generators.
It terminates with a confluent set for the given ordering of the
generators, |[a,A,b,B]|, but does not terminate with the ordering |[a,b,A,B]|.

Several of the examples are of finite groups. 
Others are monoid presentations, where generators are not supplied with
inverses. Try 'f25monoid', which is the presentation of the Fibonacci group
$F(2,5)$, but as a monoid. In fact, the structure is almost identical to
the group in this example. The group is cyclic of order 11.
The monoid has order 12, the extra element being the empty word.
The corresponding semigroup (without the empty word) is isomorphic to the
group.

In the examples 'nilp2', 'nonhopf', 'heinnilp' and 'verfiynilp', the
'recursive' ordering is essential. The last two of these are examples of
the use of Knuth--Bendix to prove that a presentation defines a nilpotent
group (first proposed by Sims). In 'verifynilp', things are made much
easier by using the 'maxstoredlen' parameter (or equivalently the '-mrl'
option). (Appropriate settings are already in the input file.)

The example 'f27monoid' is a monoid presentation
corresponding to the Fibonacci group $F(2,7)$, which has order 29.  As is
the case with $F(2,5)$, the monoid is the same structure with the empty
word thrown in, but this example is rather more difficult for 'kbprog'.
The best approach is to use a recursive ordering with a limit on the
lengths of equations stored ('-mrl 15 15' works well for 'f27monoid').
This will halt with the warning message that information may have been lost.
The original equations should then be adjoined to the output equations,
which is achieved by re-running 'kbprog' with the '-ro' option,
(and no limits on lengths).
It will then quickly complete with a confluent set. This is typical of a
number of difficult examples, where good results can be obtained by running
more than once.
