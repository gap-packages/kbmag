'kbprogcos' is a version of 'kbprog' (see Section "kbprog") that is specially
adapted for operating on coset rewriting systems, which were described in
Section "makecosfile".  It can be used either as a standalone or
(with the '-wd' option) as part of the automatic coset system
program 'autcos'. Only its use as a standalone will be described in this
chapter. The other usage will be dealt with in Chapter
"The Automatic Coset System and Subgroup Presentation Package".
All of the options except '-f' are the same as for 'kbprog', and will not
be described here. The '-f' option is described at the end of the section.
Since '``wreathprod\'\''  is the only allowable ordering for words, there are
no ordering options.

'kbprogcos' takes its input from the file <groupname>.<cosname>,
where <cosname> defaults to 'cos'. This should contain a
declaration of a record defining a coset rewriting-system, in the format
described in Chapter "Subgroup and Coset Files".
(Normally  the file <groupname>.<cosname> will have been created
from a rewriting system for a group $G$ in the file <groupname>,
and a subgroup $H$ of $G$, by a call of the program 'makecosfile'.)
Output is to two files, <groupname>.<cosname>'.kbprog' and
<groupname>.<cosname>'.reduce'. The first contains an updated declaration of
the original coset rewriting-system, in which the |equations|\ field contains
the list of all reduction equations found so far. If the process has completed,
and the system is now confluent, then a new field |isConfluent| will
have appeared, and will be set equal to 'true'. In the equations,
the left hand side will always be greater than the right hand side in the
ordering on strings that is being used.
The second file contains a finite state automaton,
which can be used, together with the contents of the first file,
to reduce words and cosets in the group and subgroup generators. This is done
using the program 'wordreduce' with the '-cos' option
(see Section "wordreduce -cos (Knuth--Bendix)").

There are three types of generators in a coset rewriting system,
the $G$-generators, which are the generators of $G$ coming from the
original rewriting system for $G$, the symbol '\_H', which represents the
subgroup $H$ itself and, optionally, the $H$-generators, which should be
distinct from the $G$-generators, and are independent names for
the generators of the subgroup $H$.
There are also three types of equations, those in the $G$-generators alone,
those involving the generator '\_H', and those in the $H$-generators alone.
(Of course, there will be none of the third type if $H$-generators are
not present.) The left and right hand sides of the equations involving
'\_H' should have the form <v>'\_H'<w>, where <v> is a (possibly empty)
word in the $H$-generators, and <w> a (possibly empty) word in the
$G$-generators. In fact, those in the input file should all have the
form '[\_H'<w>,'\_H]', or '[\_H'<w>,<x>'\_H]' for some $H$-generator <x>,
and they define the generators of $H$ as words <w> in the $G$-generators.
The order of the equations in the input file is unimportant, but in the
output file, the equations contaiaing '\_H' will come first, then the
$G$-equations, and finally the $H$-equations (if any).
The ordering of words in a coset rewriting system must be '``wreathprod\'\'',
and '\_H' and the $H$-generators must all have a strictly smaller level than
each of the $G$-generators. This is to ensure that words containing
'\_H' get themselves reduced to the desired form <v>'\_H'<w> with the
word <w> coming as early as possible in the ordering of the $G$-words.

The previous paragraph can be taken as a definition of a coset rewriting
system. Any input not conforming to these rules will either be rejected
as invalid by 'kbprogcos', or will produce meaningless results.
Of course, if the input is produced using 'makecosfile' as recommended,
then it will be guaranteed to be valid.

If the output system is confluent, then the sets of the three types of
equations will be confluent individually in the following sense.
The $G$-equations will form a confluent system for $G$, just as they
would if 'kbprog' had been run on $G$. 
The equations involving '\_H' together with the $G$-equations will
be sufficient to reduce any coset '\_H'<w>, with <w> a word in the
$G$-generators, to '\_H'$w^\prime$ (or <x>'\_H'$w^\prime$ if $H$-generators are
present), where $w^\prime$ is the least word (under the ordering being used)
in the $G$-generators that lies in the coset $Hw$. If $H$-generators are
present, then the equality $w = xw^\prime$ will hold in $G$.
The $H$-equations, if present, will form a confluent rewriting system for
$H$ (and so we will, in particular, have computed a presentation for the
subgroup $H$).

Of course, for infinite groups, 'kbprogcos', like 'kbprog',
will more often than not run forever by default.
The halting conditions that can be imposed by the user, either by
setting appropriate fields in the input file, or by using
command-line options, are the same as for 'kbprog', so we will not
repeat their description here.  As with 'kbprog',
it is also possible to halt the program interactively at any stage, by
sending it a single interrupt signal (which usually means typing Control-C).
If you do this, then it will halt and output at the next convenient
opportunity, and so you may have to wait a while. If you send two interrupt
signals, then it will abort immediately without outputting.

*The '-f' option*\\
This option is only useful when the index of $H$ in $G$ is finite.
The theory behind it is described in Section 3.10 of \cite{Sims94}.

When '-f' is called, if 'kbprogcos' finds at some stage that there are only
finitely many irreducible words of the form '\_H'<w> (which implies
that $\|G\:H\|$ is finite), then it halts after making a limited number of
further overlap tests, without the system necessarily being confluent.
At this stage, it is guaranteed that all words of the form '\_H'<w>
reduce under the system to '\_H'$w^\prime$ (or <x>'\_H'$w^\prime$), where
$w^\prime$ is the correct minimal word that lies in in the coset '\_H'<w>.
In other words, it reduces cosets of $H$ correctly, even though it may not
reduce all $G$-words or $H$-words correctly. However, if $H$-generators are
present, then it is also guaranteed that the $H$-equations will form a
presentation of $H$ (although not necessarily a confluent one).
The index of $H$ in $G$ will be equal to the number of irreducible words of
form '\_H'<w>, and will be printed as a message by 'kbprogcos' before it
halts.

Conversely, if the index of $H$ in $G$ is finite, and the '-f' option is
called, then it can be proved that the algorithm employed will eventually
halt, although it may take a long time. So it can be used as an
alternative to Todd-Coxeter coset enumeration for calculating $\|G\:H\|$, and
to the modified Todd-Coxeter method of calculating subgroup presentations.
However, it does appear that the Todd-Coxeter based methods are more
efficient in most examples.

*Exit status*\\
The exit status is 0 if either 'kbprogcos' completes with a confluent set of
equations, or if the '-f' option is called and it halts with correct
reduction of cosets. The exit status is
2 if 'kbprogcos' halts and outputs a non-confluent set because some limit has
been exceeded, or it has received an interrupt signal, and 1 if it exits
without output, with an error message.

\Section{wordreduce -cos (Knuth--Bendix)}
'wordreduce -cos [-kbprog/-diff1/-diff2] [-mrl <maxreducelen>]'\\ 
'| || || || || || || || || || || |<groupname> [<cosname>]'

'wordreduce -cos' can be used either on the output of 'kbprogcos' or on the
output of the automatic coset system package. The '[-diff<x>]' options refer to
the latter use, which is described in Section
"wordreduce -cos (automatic coset systems)".
The former use is the default if the file <groupname>.<cosname>'.kbprog' is
present; to be certain, call the '-kbprog' option explicitly.
As with 'kbprogcos', <cosname> defaults to 'cos'.

'wordreduce -cos' reduces words using the output of a run of 'kbprogcos',
which is read from the files <groupname>.<cosname>'.kbprog' and
<groupname>.<cosname>'.reduce'.  These words should either (in the notation of
the preceding section) be in the $G$-generators alone, the $H$-generators
alone, or of the form <v>'\_H'<w>, where <v> is a (possibly empty)
word in the $H$-generators, and <w> a (possibly empty) word in the
$G$-generators. If there are no $H$-generators, then the words '\_H'<w>
represent cosets of $H$ in $G$. Otherwise they represent the element
<vw> of $G$, and the symbol '\_H' is being used as a separator.

The reductions will always be correct in the sense that the output word will
represent the same group element or coset as the input word. If the system of
equations in <groupname>.<cosname>'.kbprogcos'
is confluent, then the reduction will be to the minimal word that represents
the group element or coset under the ordering on strings of generators that
was used by 'kbprogcos'. Note that the ordering used for coset rewriting
systems ensures that in a mixed word of form <v>'\_H'<w>, the reduction
will be to $v^\prime$'\_H'$w^\prime$ for smallest possible $w^\prime$, and
so $w^\prime$ is the minimal coset representative of '\_H'<w>.
It can therefore be used to solve the word problem in the group $G$ and
the membership problem for the subgroup $H$.

If the program halted normally on using the '-f' option of 'kbprogcos',
then the the reduction will be correct on cosets of $H$, even though the
system may not be confluent, and not all $G$-words (or $H$-words) will
reduce correctly.

The option '-mrl\ <maxreducelen>' is the same as in 'kbprogcos'.

\Section{fsacount and fsaenumerate(Knuth--Bendix)}

If these programs are run on the output automata in the file
<groupname>.<cosname>'.reduce', then they will count or enumerate all
accepted words of the automata, which include the $G$-words, the
words '\_H'<w> (or <x>'\_H'<w>) and (if present) the $H$-words.
So, if $H$ is a subgroup of order $l$ and index $m$ in a group
of order $n$ then, if $H$-generators are not present, there will be
$n+m$ accepted words (for the group elements and the cosets of $H$).
If $H$-generators are present, then the number of accepted words will
be $2n+l-1$, comprising $n$ $G$-words, $n$ mixed words of form <x>'\_H'<w>
(one for each group element), and $l$ $H$-words. However, the empty word
is both a $G$-word and an $H$-word, which accounts for the $-1$ in the
expression. 

It is possible to count or enumerate just the coset representatives
$w$ occurring in the cosets '\_H'<w> or mixed words  <x>'\_H'<w>, by
calling 'fsacount' or 'fsaenumerate' with the option '-is 2'.
This re-defines the initial state of the automaton to be 2, which has
the effect that the words counted or enumerated are those of the
form '\_H'<w>, but with the '\_H' removed. If $H$ has finite index
$m$ in $G$, then there will be exactly $m$ such words $w$.

\Section{Examples of Knuth--Bendix on coset rewriting systems}

The 'subgp\_data' directory contains a number of examples of rewriting
systems for groups together with some defined subgroups. Some of these,
including the Coxeter groups, 'gunn' and 'f28', are intended for use with
the automatic coset structure programs described in Chapter
"The Automatic Coset System and Subgroup Presentation Package",
and 'kbprogcos' will not complete on them.

The example 'ab2' is the free abelian group of rank 2, and the subgroup
defined in 'ab2.sub' has index 6. First run

|
 >makecosfile ab2
|

to create a coset rewriting system for this subgroup (without $H$-generators)
in the file 'ab2.cos'. If 'kbprogcos' is run with no options on this system,
then it does not halt, but with the '-f' option we get\:

|
 >kbprogcos  -f ab2
#Coset language has size 6. Setting maxoverlap length to 7.
#System is not guaranteed confluent, since not all overlaps were processed.
#Output\:\ 28 eqns; table has 24 states.
#Halting with 28 equations.
|

and from the first line of the output we know that the index is 6.
We can check this by using 'fsacount'. To count the cosets alone
(omitting the $G$-words, which correspond to  elements of $G$), use
the option '-is 2', as described above.

|
 >fsacount ab2.cos.reduce
#The language accepted is infinite.
 >fsacount -is 2 ab2.cos.reduce
#The language accepted has size 6.
 >
|

The example '8l32' is a finite group of order 1344, and '8l32.sub' is a
normal subgroup of order 8 and index 168. (The quotient group is
${\rm PSL}(3,2)$.) Below, we introduce $H$-generators, by using the '-sg'
option with 'makecosfile'.

|
 >makecosfile -sg 8l32
 >kbprogcos 8l32
#System is confluent.
#Output\:\ 828 eqns; table has 724 states.
#Halting with 828 equations.
 >fsacount 8l32.cos.reduce
#The language accepted has size 2695.
 >fsacount -is 2 8l32.cos.reduce
#The language accepted has size 168.
|

The 2695 words accepted by the word-reduction automaton consist of 1344
$G$-words, 1344 mixed words, and 8 $H$-words, where the empty word is both
a $G$-word and an $H$-word. When the initial state is set to 2, we just get
the coset representatives. They can be enumerated in length-increasing
order by running

|
 >fsaenumerate -is 2 -bfs 0 200 8l32.cos.reduce
|

and the list of words is output to the file '8l32.cos.reduce.enumerate'.
We used a large upper length limit (200) for the search to ensure that we got
everything.
