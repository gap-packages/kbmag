%%
%%  <item>: <text>
%%
%%  This formats the  paragraph  <text>, i.e.,  everything between  the colon
%%  '\:' and the next  empty  line, indented 1 cm to the right in the manual.
%%  This
%%  convention should be  used to format  a list or an enumeration.    <item>
%%  should be  a single  word  or a short phrase.  It  may contain  all usual
%%  characters and the usual formatting stuff.  <text> is a  normal paragraph
%%  and may contain everything.   \:  can be used  to enter a colon character
%%  into the text.  As  an example consider the  following description.  This
%%  will print quite similar in the printed manual.
%%
%%      A group is represented by a record that must have the components
%%
%%      'generators': \\
%%              a list of group elements that  generate  the  group  that  is
%%              given by the group record.
%%
%%      'identity': \\
%%              the identity element of the group that is given by the  group
%%              record.

%%  "reference"
%%
%%  "reference" prints the  number of the  chapter or section  in the printed
%%  manual and is  displayed unchanged  in the  on-screen  documentation.  It
%%  should be used when referring to other  chapters or  sections.   The text
%%  should  not contain any special characters.  \"  can be  used  to enter a

%%  \GAP
%%
