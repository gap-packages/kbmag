The &KBMAG; package contains &GAP; interfaces to many of the functions
for manipulating finite state automata (&fsa;) that are available in the
stand-alone.  We shall list these here, without giving much detail.
For more detail, the user could try looking in the source file
<File>gap/fsa4.g</File>.

<Section Label="sec-manip-fsa">
<Heading>Functions for manipulating finite state automata</Heading>

<Index Key="finite state automata">finite state automata</Index> 

&fsa; are currently implemented as &GAP; records, as they were
previously in &GAP;3. This interface may be updated to the style of
&GAP;4 at some stage. (Note that the abbreviation &fsa; will be used for
both singular and the plural.)
<P/>
The alphabet of an &fsa; is itself a record that must contain at least
the two components <C>type</C> and <C>size</C>, 
where <C>type</C> is a string, and <C>size</C> a positive integer. 
The easiest possibility is to use the
type <C>simple</C>, and then no other record components are necessary.
There are several more complicated possibilities, which are used by
the other rewriting system functions. For example, there is the type
<C>identifiers</C>, for which fields <C>format</C> 
and <C>names</C> are necessary.
For example: 
<P/>
<Example>
<![CDATA[
gap> M := FreeMonoid( 3 );;
gap> alph := rec( type := "identifiers", size := 3,
>                 format := "dense", names := [M.1,M.2,M.3] );;
]]>
</Example>
defines a valid alphabet for an &fsa;.
The members of the alphabet are referred to as <C>letters</C>, and can be
represented either by a positive integer or by their name (usually
a generator of a free group or monoid) if they have one.
<P/>
The functions <Ref Func="ReductionAutomaton"/>,  
<Ref Func="WordAcceptor"/>,
<Ref Func="FirstWordDifferenceAutomaton"/>, 
<Ref Func="SecondWordDifferenceAutomaton"/> 
and <Ref Func="GeneralMultiplier"/>  
mentioned in earlier sections all return a &fsa;. 
The other possibilities for the user to construct
a &fsa; are to use the function <Ref Func="FSA"/>  
or to read one in from a file.
In the latter case, the user must immediately call 
<Ref Func="InitializeFSA"/> on the record that has been read in. 
For example, running &GAP; from the package directory:
<P/>
<Example>
<![CDATA[
gap> Read( "standalone/fsa_data/fsa_2" );
gap> InitializeFSA( fsa_2 );
]]>
</Example>
